He was transferred immediately to [**Hospital1 18**] and once arrived had multiple cupfuls of hemoptysis. He was intubated and taken to the OR for rigid bronch to locate the source of bleeding. Will need angio for embolization once source is localized. He was recently given a prescription for sorafenib, but it is unclear if he actually had started this treatment. Of note, he was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] in [**7-28**] with hemoptysis (two small episodes) for which he underwent bronchoscopic evaluation which demonstrated a likelihood of suspicious lesions in the right upper lobe and left superior lingula with no active bleeding. He was discharged at that time with therapeutic INR. Ortho was consulted to evaluate patient's current status of known lytic lesions in C1.  On review of his past oncologic history, he was diagnosed in [**2149**] when he developed significant snoring related problems that required seeking medical attention.  He saw an otorhinolaryngologist who at that time reported that he had neck swelling which was contributing to his snoring and which was likely related to a thyroid process.  He then reported that he had this swelling for about 10 years prior to this presentation, but a workup had not been performed at that time.  A surgical resection demonstrated a papillary carcinoma.  He subsequently received radioactive iodine therapy for this disease and appeared to have tolerated it well.  His treatment was complicated by atrial fibrillation, and was placed on atenolol. He subsequently required repetition of his radioactive iodine treatments because of elevated thyroglobulin levels as well as because of the appearance of new lung metastases.

He was started on coumadin in [**1-28**] for a PE and in the summer of [**2159**], the patient had two episodes of hemoptysis during exertion, which required a bronchoscopic evaluation and ablation of the lesion.

After a few hrs, she had voluminous \"black\" diarrhea x2 associated with diaphoresis, palpitations, and lightheadedness. She had taken two Aleve the night prior to admission for her joint pain. . Pt has had 2 prior similar episodes of hematemesis in her life, one 50 yrs ago, one 9 yrs ago.  The episode 50 yrs ago was due to ulcers, and pt had gastrectomy performed.

The right coronary artery was thought to be the culprit but at the time of catheterization, no arteries needed intervention.  The distal PDA lesion underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.  Post-catheterization, the patient had bradycardia and hypotension and a re-look catheterization was without any significant changes.  Her hospital course was also significant for intubation for lactic acidosis.  The patient was re-admitted in early [**Month (only) 205**] for shortness of breath and mental status changes.  She was found to have stable pleural effusions secondary to congestive heart failure and was medically stabilized.  At that time, she opted for comfort care, however, when she came from rehabilitation at this time, her code status was changed to Full Code in the interim.  On [**8-14**], she complained of substernal chest pain, shortness of breath and diaphoresis.  The Emergency Medical System was activated and found the patient to be hypotensive with altered mental status.  Per report, the patient was lying semi-recumbent, nonresponsive except when verbally stimulated.  She was placed on two liters of nasal cannula oxygen and was noted to have cold and clammy extremities. She received three sublingual Nitroglycerin tablets earlier.  At [**Hospital1 **], she was hypotensive with blood pressure 68/38 and pulse 60.  She was started on Dobutamine and heparin.  Lytics were also started at that time.  EKG was notable for diffuse ST elevations in weeks II, III and AVF as well as V1 through V5.  She was intubated for airway protection on the way to [**Hospital1 69**] for emergent catheterization.  The catheterization was notable for right coronary artery tapering occlusion without changes in other vessels.  She was given Nitroglycerin with resolution of occlusion, suggestive of a spasm.  The stent was deployed to the site of the spasm.

In the ambulance, the patient was given two sublingual nitroglycerin and put on oxygen.  She arrived at [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department where her EKG revealed ST elevations in leads V1 through lead V4 and left axis deviation.  She was treated with Fentanyl, nitroglycerin, Integrelin, and heparin drips.  She was subsequently transferred to [**Hospital6 1760**] for further management.  On arrival to [**Hospital3 **] Hospital, her EKG showed left axis deviation, ST elevations in leads V1 through V4 and ST depressions in the inferior leads.  The patient was subsequently taken to the Catheterization Laboratory where she was found to have a 100% proximal LAD occlusion which was stented without complication.  She also had a mid RCA lesion of 50% and a 40% distal RCA lesion.  Her left main coronary artery was within normal limits.
