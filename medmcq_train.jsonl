Congenital adrenal hyperplasia represents a group of autosomal recessive inherited, metabolic errors, each characterized by decency or total lack of a particular enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cortical steroids, Steroidogenesis is then channelled into other pathways leading to increased production of androgens, which accounts for virilization. Simultaneously, the decency of cortisol results in increased secretion of ACTH resulting in adrenal hyperplasia. Following enzymes are implicated in the congenital adrenal hyperplasia 21 α hydroxylase decency (partial or complete) 17 α hydroxylase deficiency 11β hydroxylase deficiency 21 α hydroxylase deficiency • Two forms of this deficiency include - A. Salt-wasting adrenogenital ism B. Simple Virilizing adrenogenital ism A) Salt-wasting syndrome (complete lack) The salt wasting syndrome results from complete lack of 21 hydroxylases. There is no synthesis of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids in the adrenal cortex. Decreased mineralocorticoids causes marked sodium loss in the urine, resulting in hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, acidosis and hypotension. Because of the enzyme block, there is increased formation of 17 - hydroxyprogesterone, which is then shunted into the production of testosterone. This may cause virilism (pseudo-hermaphroditism) in female infants. That is (XX) Female with 21 hydroxylase deficiency develops ovaries, female ductal structures and external male genitalia. But in the male child, the effect of increased testosterone will not be manifested at the time of birth. The complete21 hydroxylase deficiency or salt wasting syndrome usually comes to light only after the birth because in utero the electrolytes and uids can be maintained by maternal kidneys. Males with this disorder comes to clinical attention 5 to 15 days later because of salt losing crisis while females come to attention soon after the birth because of the virilization. B) Simple Virilizing adrenogenital syndrome (Partial deficiency) Occurs in individuals with partial deficiency of 21 hydroxylases Less severe deficiency of mineralocorticoid, is sufficient for salt reabsorption, but the lowered glucocorticoid fails to cause feedback inhibition of ACTH secretion. Thus level of aldosterone is mildly reduced, testosterone is increased and ACTH elevated with resultant adrenal hyperplasia. 11B hydroxylase deficiency-. Rare Leads to decreased cortisol and increased ACTH. This, in turn, leads to the accumulation of DOC (deoxycorticosterone) and 11 deoxycortisol both of which are strong mineralocorticoids. This results in increased sodium retention by the kidneys and hypertension, hypokalemia. Patients also develop virilization due to androgen excess. 17 α hydroxylase deficiency - Patients with deficiency of 17 hydroxylases also have impaired cortisol production, increased ACTH and secondary increased DOC. These patients, however, cannot synthesize normal amount of androgens and estrogens. This is because the gene that codes for 17 α hydroxylase is the same for the enzyme in the adrenal cortex and the gonads and the decency is same in both organs. Because of decreased sex hormones, genotypic females develop primary amenorrhoea and fail to develop secondary sex characteristics while genotypic males will present as pseudohermaphrodite. 3 β hydroxylase deficiency 3-β hydroxylase deficiency is a rare genetic disorder of steroid biosynthesis that results in decreased production of all three groups of adrenal steroids which include mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid and sex steroids. Decreased mineralocorticoid secretion results in varying degrees of salt wasting in both males and females. Decent androgen production results in ambiguous genitalia in males The usual presentation is a male child with ambiguous genitalia and severe salt wasting. Sometimes it may also occur in females"}]}

Ans. C: Sympathetic ophthalmia Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) is a condition in which serious inflammation attacks the sound eye after injury (including intraocular surgeries) to the other. It is the most dreaded complication of unilateral severe eye injury, as it can leave the patient completely blind. Symptoms may develop from days to several years after a penetrating eye injury. Sympathetic ophthalmia is thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response toward ocular antigens, specifically a delayed hypersensitivity to melanin-containing structures from the outer segments of the photoreceptor layer of the retina. It is thought that Louis Braille, who injured his left eye as a child, lost vision in his right eye due to SO Floating spots and loss of accommodation are among the earliest symptoms. The disease may progress to severe iridocyclitis with pain and photophobia. Commonly the eye remains relatively painless while the inflammatory disease spreads through the uvea. The retina, however, usually remains uninvolved. Papilledema, secondary glaucoma, vitiligo and poliosis of the eyelashes may accompany SO. Diagnosis is clinical, seeking a history of eye injury. An impoant differential diagnosis is Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH), which is thought to have the same pathogenesis, without a history of surgery or penetrating eye injury. Definitive prevention of SO requires prompt (within the first 7 to 10 days following injury) enucleation of the injured eye. Evisceration--the removal of the contents of the globe while leaving the sclera and extraocular muscles intact--is easier to perform, offers long-term orbital stability, and is more aesthetically pleasing. But evisceration may lead to a higher incidence of SO compared to enucleation. Immunosuppressive therapy is the mainstay of treatment for SO. When initiated promptly following injury, it is effective in controlling the inflammation and improving the prognosis."}]}

Beck Cognitive therapy is a psychotherapy developed by American pyschiatrist Aaron T. Beck. Cognitive therapy is one of the therapeutic approaches within the larger group of cognitive behavioural therapies. Cognitive therapy seeks to help the client overcome difficulties by identifying and changing dysfunctional thinking, behaviour and emotional responses. This involves helping clients develop skills for modifying beliefs, identifying distoed thinkings, relative to others in different ways and changing behaviours. Treatment is based on collaboration between client and therapist and on testing beliefs. Therapy may consist of testing the assumptions which one makes and identifying how some of one's usually unquestioned thoughts are distoed, unrealistic and unhelpful. Once, those thoughts have been challenged, ones feelings about the subject matter of those thoughts are more easily subject to change. Beck initially focussed on depression and developed a list of errors in thought that he proposed could maintain depression, including arbitrary inference, selective abstraction, over generalization and magnification (of negatives) and minimization (of positives). According to Beck's theorey of the etiology of depression, depressed people acquire a negative view of the world in childhood and adolescence. Children and adolescent who suffer from depression acquire this negative view earlier. Depressed people acquire such view through a loss of a parent, rejection by peers, (criticism from teachers or parents, the depressive attitude and other negative events). When the person with such view encounters a situation that resembles the original conditions of the learned view in some way, even remotely, the negative views of the persons are activated. A simple example may illustrate the principle of how cognitive therapy works Having made a mistake at work, a person may believe \"I am useless and can't do anything right at work\". Strongly believing this then tends to worsen his mood. The problem may be worsened fuher if the individual reacts by avoiding activities and then behaviourally confirming the negative belief to himself. As a result, any adaptive response and fuher constructive consequences become unlikely, which reinforces the original belief of being useless. In therapy, the latter example could be identified as a self fulfilling prophecy or \"problem cycle\" and the effos of the therapist and client would be directed at working together to change it."}]}

Jaundice. Jaundice is not a disease but rather a sign that can occur in many different diseases. Jaundice is the yellowish staining of skin and sclerae which is caused by the high level of blood bilirubin. On the basis of etiology, jaundice can be divided into 3 types : -. 1. Prehepatic jaundice. Prehepatic jaundice is due to increased production of bilirubin which results in an increased bilirubin load presented to the liver. The liver is normal and is able to conjugate the bilirubin at a normal rate; However, due to overproduction of bilirubin, conjugation capacity of the liver is overwhelmed and unconjugated bilirubin is increased → Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Prehepatic jaundice is caused by hemolysis, i.e., hemolytic anemia due to any cause, e.g., hereditary spherocytosis, Thalassemia, SCA, Malaria, Drugs (methyldopa, quinine) etc.. 2. Hepatic jaundice. Here the cause lies within the hepatocytes which have either a defect in the conjugation process or in the excretion of conjugated bilirubin into the bile. This type of jaundice is caused by all causes of hepatitis (infection, alcohol, drugs, toxin or autoimmune); in congenital hyperbilirubenemias; and in cirrhosis.. 3. Post hepatic (extrahepatic) jaundice. Post hepatic jaundice is due to obstruction of the excretion into the bile, e.g., in stone in CBD, carcinoma pancreas, CBD carcinoma etc. Conjugation capacity of hepatocytes are normal and they continue their conjugation process without any interference leading to conjugated hyperbilirubinemia."}]}

Transposons, also called jumping genes, are pieces of DNA that move readily from one site to another. They move either within or between the DNAs of bacteria, plasmids and bacteriophages in a manner, that plasmid genes can become part of the chromosomal complement of genes. Interestingly, when transposons transfer to a new site, it is usually a copy of the transposon that moves, while the original remains in situ (like photocopying). Transposons can code for metabolic or drug resistance enzymes and toxins. They may also cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alter the expression of nearby genes. In contrast to plasmids or bacterial viruses, transposons cannot replicate independently of the recipient DNA. More than one transposon can be located in the DNA for example, resistance genes. Thus, transposons can jump from:# The host genomic DNA to a plasmid# One plasmid to another# A plasmid to genomic DNA. An insertion sequence is a short DNA sequence that acts as a simple transposable element. Insertion sequences have two major characteristics: they are small relative to other transposable elements (generally around 700 to 2500bp in length) and only code for proteins implicated in the transposition activity (they are thus different from other transposons, which also carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes."}]}

AV conduction block manifests as slow conduction in its mildest forms and failure to conduct, either intermittent of persistently, in more severe varieties.a. First degree AV block (PR interval >200ms) is a slowing of conduction through the AV junction. The site of delay is typically in the AV node but may be in the atria, bundle of his, or his Purkinje system. A wide QRS is suggestive of delay in the AV node proper or less commonly in the bundle of His. In second degree AV block there is an intermittent failure of electrical impulse conduction from atrium to ventricle.b. Second degree AV block is sub classified as Mobitz type I (Wenckebach) or Mobitz type II. The periodic failure of conduction in Mobitz, type I block is characterized by a progressively lengthening PR interval, shortening of the RR interval, and a pause that is less than the two times the immediately preceding RR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG complex after the pause exhibits a shorter PR interval than that immediately preceding the pause. This ECG pattern most often arises because of decremental conduction of electrical impulses in the AV node."}]}

After a fixed number of divisions, normal cells becomes arrested in a terminally nondividing state. How does the normal cells count their divisions i.e. How, do the cells find out that now they do'nt need to divide further.. Cells achieve this through telomer shortening . Telomers are short repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are important for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at tellninal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shortening of the telomers. Once the telomers are shortened beyond a certain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken i1 NA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The broken NA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. Thus telomere shortening functions as a clock that counts cell division. \tHow do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life??? In germ cells telomere shortening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence. This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively???? In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours. Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells."}]}

Some amino acids (isoleucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) are both glucogenic and ketogenic because their degradation pathway forms multiple products.a. Amino acids that are converted to pyruvate (see Figure I).(1). The amino acids that are synthesized from the intermediates of glycolysis (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine) are degraded to form pyruvate.(a). Serine is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, or directly to pyruvate and NH4+ by serine dehydratase, an enzyme that requires PLP.(b). Glycine, in a reversal of the reaction utilized for its synthesis, reacts with methylene-FH4 to form serine.1. Glycine also reacts with FH4 and NAD+ to produce CO2 and NH4+ (glycine cleavage enzyme).2. Glycine can be converted to glyoxylate, which can be oxidized to CO2 and H2 O or converted to oxalate.(c). Cysteine forms pyruvate. Its sulfur, which was derived from methionine, is converted to H2 SO4 , which is excreted by the kidneys.(d). Alanine can be transaminated to pyruvate.b. Amino acids that are converted to intermediates of the TCA cycle (see Figure II).(1). The carbons from the four groups of amino acids form the TCA cycle intermediates: a-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and oxaloacetate.(a). Amino acids that form a-ketoglutarate (see Figure III).1. Glutamate can be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form a- ketoglutarate.2. Glutamine is converted by glutaminase to glutamate with the release of its amide nitrogen as NH4+ 3. Proline is oxidized so that its ring opens, forming glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.4. Arginine is cleaved by arginase in the liver to form urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transaminated to glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.5. Histidine is converted to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The formimino group is transferred to FH4, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate.(b). Amino acids that form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV)1. Four amino acids are converted to propionyl-CoA, which is carboxylated in a biotin requiring reaction to form methylmalonyl-CoA, which is rearranged to form succinyl-CoA in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 (seen previously in the metabolism of odd-chain number fatty acids).a). Threonine is converted by a dehydratase to NH4+ and a-ketobutyrate, which is oxidatively decarboxylated to propionyl-CoA.In a different set of reactions, threonine is converted to glycine and acetyl-CoA.b). Methionine provides methyl groups for the synthesis of various compounds; its sulfur is incorporated into cysteine; and the remaining carbons form succinyl-CoA.i. Methionine and ATP form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates a methyl group and forms homocysteine.ii. Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by accepting a methyl group from the FH4 pool via vitamin B12 .iii. Homocysteine can also react with serine to form cystathionine. The cleavage of cystathionine produces cysteine, NH4+ , and a-ketobutyrate, which is converted to propionyl-CoA.c). Valine and isoleucine, two of the three branched-chain amino acids, form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV).i. The degradation of all the three branched-chain amino acids begins with a transamination followed by an oxidative decarboxylation catalysed by the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (Figure V). This enzyme, like pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, CoA, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NAD+.ii. Valine is eventually converted to succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methyl malonyl-CoA.iii. Isoleucine also forms succinyl-CoA after two of its carbons are released as acetyl-CoA.(c). Amino acids that form fumarate1. Three amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and aspartate) are converted to fumarate (see Figure II).a). Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in a reaction requiring tetrahydrobiopterin and O2 (Figure VI).b). Tyrosine, obtained from the diet or by hydroxylation of phenylalanine, is converted to homogentisic acid. The aromatic ring is opened and cleaved, forming fumarate and acetoacetate.c). Aspartate is converted to fumarate via reactions of the urea cycle and the purine nucleotide cycle.d). Aspartate reacts with IMP to form AMP and fumarate in the purine nucleotide cycle.(d). Amino acids that form oxaloacetate (see Figure II)1. Aspartate is transaminated to form oxaloacetate.2. Asparagine loses its amide nitrogen as NH4+ , forming aspartate in a reaction catalyzed by asparaginase.c. Amino acids that are converted to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate (see Figure VI).(1). Four amino acids (lysine, threonine, isoleucine, and tryptophan) can form acetyl-CoA, and phenylalanine and tyrosine form acetoacetate. Leucine is degraded to form both acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.Pellagra is caused by a dietary deficiency of niacin, beriberi is caused by a lack of thiamine (vitamin B-,), scurvy caused by a lack of vitamin C, and rickets from a lack of vitamin D.I. Amino acids derived from the intermediates of glycolysis. These amino acids can be synthesized from glucose and can be reconverted to glucose in the liver.II. The degradation of amino acids. A. Amino acids that produce pyruvate or the intermediates of the TCA cycle. These amino acids are considered glucogenic because their carbons can produce glucose in the liver. B. Amino acids that produce acetyl-CoA or ketone bodies. These amino acids are considered ketogenic. CoA, coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.III. Amino acids related through glutamate. These amino acids contain carbons that can be converted to glutamate, which can be converted to glucose in the liver. All of these amino acids except histidine can be synthesized from glucose.IV. Amino acids that can be converted to succinyl-CoA. The amino acids methionine, threonine, isoleucine, and valine, which form succinyl-CoA via methyl malonyl-CoA, are all essential. Because succinyl-CoA can form glucose, these amino acids are glucogenic. The carbons of serine are converted to cysteine and do not form succinyl-CoA by this pathway. A defect in cystathionine synthase causes homocystinuria. A defect in cystathionase causes cystathioninuria. B12-CH3, methyl cobalamin; N5-CH3-FH4, N 5- methyl tetrahydrofolate; PLP, pyridoxal phosphate; SAM, S-adenosylmethionine; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.V. The degradation of the branched-chain amino acids.

This is caused by mutations of the KIT proto-oncogene. 14 point mutations, 9 deletions, 2 nucleotide splice mutations, and 3 inseions of the KIT gene are believed to be mutations causing piebaldism. The severity of the condition correlates with the site of the mutation within the KIT gene. Piebaldism is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder meaning half of an affected person's children will also have the condition. Piebaldism is one of the cutaneous signs of Waardenburg syndrome. Piebaldism is a rare inherited condition characterised by: White forelock in 80-90% of those affected (poliosis) White patch (due to absence of pigmentation) of the central poion of the forehead Eyebrow and eyelash hair may also be affected, either continuously or discontinuously with the forelock White patches of skin may also be seen on the face (paicularly the chin), trunk and extremities (hands and feet are not usually affected) Often a narrow border of hyperpigmented skin surrounds the white unpigmented patches Sometimes islands of normal or hyperpigmented skin occur within the white patches. Albinism is a condition in which people have little or no melanin pigment (compound that creates colour) in their eyes, skin or hair. Because of this people with albinism look a little different from other members of their family without albinism. They have very fair skin which is prone to sunburn, their hair is white or a very light colour, and they may squint a lot as their eyes are sensitive to sunlight."}]}

Also known as papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum. The tumor arises only in the parotid gland. Almost always arises in the lower poion of the parotid gland overlying the angle of mandible. Common in males. (Occurs most often in older white men) Age : 5th to 7th decade. Association is seen with smoking. Bilaterality is seen in 10% cases. Its well encapsulated, extremely slow growing tumor, never turns malignant. A peculiar feature of Wahins tumor is that it shows 'hot' spot in 99' Tc-peechnate scan. Other tumors of the parotid show 'cold' spot (Oncocytomas another benign parotid tumor also shows hot spot). (Because of the high mitochondrial content within oncocytes, the oncocyte-rich Wahin tumor and Oncocytomas incorporate technetium Tc 99m and appear as hot spots on radionuclide scans.) Also remember Godwin's tumor - Benign lymphoepithelial tumor of the parotid gland. Most salivary gland tumors are benign. However remember that the smaller the salivary gland, the higher is the chance of the tumor being malignant. Parotid gland - 80% benign Submandibular, Sublingual - 50% benign, 50% malignant Minor salivary glands - 25% benign, 75% malignant"}]}

Both bivalent and Quadrivalent Currently, there are two types of cervical cancer vaccines available Gardasil vaccine (quadrivalent vaccine) Cervavarix vaccine (Bivalent vaccine) Gardasil vaccine Gardasil is a quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine. Gardasil is the only vaccine that helps protect against 4 types - types 6, 11, 16, 18 - of HPV. - The vaccine helps prevent diseases such as cervical cancer, abnormal and precancerous cervical lesions, vaginal lesions, vulvar lesions, and genital was, caused by these strains of HPV. Gardasil contains recombinant virus like paicle (VLPs) assembled from the Ll proteins of HPVs 6, 11, 16 and 18. - Since VLPs lack the viral DNA, they cannot induce cancer. They do, however, trigger an antibody response that protects vaccine recipients from becoming infected with the HPV Ives represented in the vaccine. Gardasil is recommended to be given to females aged between 9 to 26 years Gardasil provides 98% protection against cervical pre-cancers caused by HPV types 16 & 18, which are responsible for 70% of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. Similarly, in large placebo controlled, double blind, randomized, multicentric studies, the vaccine has also been proven to be 90% effective in the prevention of genital was caused by HPV types 6 and 11, which are responsible for 90% of all genital was cases worldwide. According to the Indian Academy of Pediatrics Committee of Immunization (L4PC01) 2008 recommendations : \"This vaccine has a .orable tolerability profile and the IAP-001 recommends offering HPV vaccine to all females as per label. The recommended age for initiation of vaccination is 10-12 years and catch up vaccination is permitted up to the age of 26 years. It is recommended to be given in three doses at 0, 2 and 6 months\". Gardasil is usually given in the arm muscle. Three shots are given on the following schedule: - Dose 1 -? - Dose 2 --4 2 months after Dose 1 - Dose 3 -4 6 months after Dose 1 Cervarix Cervarix is a vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18, which currently cause about 70% of cervical cancer cases. - Cervarix is a preventative cervical cancer vaccine, not therapeutic; Cervarix vaccine will not block infection .from cervical cancer-causing HPV strains other than HPV 16, 18, 31 and 45. Cervarix is using the \"L1 protein\" of the viral capsid. The viral proteins induce the .fonnation of neutralizing antibodies. The vaccine contains no live virus and no DNA, so it cannot infect the patient. Cervari data from patients show that at 18 months after the first of a three-dose regimen, 100 percent of women up to age 55 vaccinated with cervarix vaccine had antibodies present against the two most common cancer-causing human papillomavirus types, 16 and 18. Cervarix Vs. Gardasil: which is the better cervical cancer vaccine ? Cervarix is \"bivalent\" -effective against only two strains of the virus-vaccine. While Gardasil is \"quadrivalent\" vaccine (effective against four common strains of HPV). The question now arises which vaccine to be the vaccine of choice?? On the face of it a quadrivalent vaccine seems to be the better choice. In reality that is not so - The vaccine protects against the HPV viruses 16, 18, 6, 11, of which only the .first two are responsible for cervical cancer, while the other two are responsible for genital was. On the other hand cervarix gives protection against 16 and 18. It is better because, there is cross-reactive protection against the virus strains 45 and 31, two other viruses causing cervical cancer. Cervarix is formulated with ASO4, a propriety adjuvant that boosts the immune system response .for a longer period of time. Both vaccines are against the human papillom virus but cervarix seems to be more effective against cancer cervix. Cervarix can be given to females between 10 to 45 yrs old whereas Gardasil can be given to females between 10 to 26 yrs only. Both the vaccines are given in the schedule of 0, 1, 6 months, Cervarix is the costlier one being priced at Rs.3200 per dose. \"Cervarix seems to win against Gardasil because of its stronger immune response and broader protection\"."}]}

Protein synthesis is a cytoplasmic process.    Fatty acid synthesis starts with the production of Acetyl Co A within the mitochondria .    β-oxidation of fatty acid oxidation also occurs in mitochondria. Mitochondrial DNA synthesis occurs within the mitochondria . Protein synthesis Process whereby DNA encodes for the production of amino acids and proteins. This process can be divided into two parts: 1. Transcription Before the synthesis of a protein begins, the corresponding RNA molecule is produced by RNA transcription. One strand of the DNA double helix is used as a template by the RNA polymerase to synthesize a messenger RNA (mRNA). This mRNA migrates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. During this step, mRNA goes through different types of maturation including one called splicing when the non-coding sequences are eliminated. The coding mRNA sequence can be described as a unit of three nucleotides called a codon. 2. Translation The ribosome binds to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) that is recognized only by the initiator tRNA. The ribosome proceeds to the elongation phase of protein synthesis. During this stage, complexes, composed of an amino acid linked to tRNA, sequentially bind to the appropriate codon in mRNA by forming complementary base pairs with the tRNA anticodon. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA. Amino acids are added one by one, translated into polypeptidic sequences dictated by DNA and represented by mRNA. At the end, a release factor binds to the stop codon, terminating translation and releasing the complete polypeptide from the ribosome. One specific amino acid can correspond to more than one codon. The genetic code is said to be degenerate."}]}

Parathyroid glands: The parathyroid glands are small, yellowish-brown, ovoid or lentiform structures, usually lies between the posterior lobar borders of the thyroid gland and its capsule. They are commonly 6 mm long, 3-4 mm across, and 1-2 mm from back to front, each weighing about 50 mg. Usually, there are two on each side, superior and inferior. Variations: There may be only three or many minute parathyroid islands scattered in connective tissue near the usual sites. Normally the inferior parathyroids migrate only to the inferior thyroid poles, but they may descend with the thymus into the thorax or not descend at all, remaining above their normal level near the carotid bifurcation. To help identification, the anastomotic connection between the superior and inferior thyroid arteries along the posterior border of the thyroid gland usually passes very close to the parathyroids. The inferior pair are more variably situated, and may be within the fascial thyroid sheath, below the inferior thyroid arteries and near the inferior lobar poles; or outside the sheath, immediately above an inferior thyroid artery; or in the thyroid gland near its inferior pole. The superior parathyroids are usually dorsal, the inferior parathyroids ventral, to the recurrent laryngeal nerves. Vasculature: The parathyroid glands have a rich blood supply from the inferior thyroid arteries or from anastomoses between the superior and inferior vessels. Approximately one-third of human parathyroid glands have two or more parathyroid arteries. Lymph vessels are numerous and associated with those of the thyroid and thymus glands.  Nerve supply:The nerve supply is sympathetic, either direct from the superior or middle cervical ganglia or via a plexus in the fascia on the posterior lobar aspects. Parathyroid activity is controlled by variations in blood calcium level: it is inhibited by a rise and stimulated by a fall. The nerves are believed to be vasomotor but not secretomotor Histology : Contains two types of cells Active cells or chief cells which produce parathormone. Chief cells differ ultrastructurally according to their level of activity: active chief cells have large Golgi complexes with numerous vesicles and small membrane-bound granules. Glycogen granules are most abundant in inactive cells, which appear histologically as ‘clear' cells. In normal human parathyroid glands, inactive chief cells outnumber active cells in a ratio of 3-5:1 Second cell type, the oxyphil (eosinophil) cell, appears just before puberty and increases in number with age. Oxyphil cells are larger than chief cells and contain more cytoplasm, which stains deeply with eosin. Their nuclei are smaller and more darkly staining than those of chief cells, and their cytoplasm is unusually rich in mitochondria. The functional significance of oxyphil cells and their relationship to chief cells are uncertain"}]}

Immunocompetent T cells in graft tissue Graft versus host disease Graft versus host disease occurs in any situation in which immunologically competent cells or their precursors are transplanted into immunologically crippled patients and the transferred cells recognize alloantigens in the host. Graft versus host disease occurs most commonly in the setting of allogenic bone marrow transplantation but may also follow transplantation of solid organs rich in lymphoid cells (e.g. the liver) or transfusion of unirradiated blood. Recipients of bone marrow transplants are immunodeficient because of either their primary disease or prior treatment of the disease with drugs or irradiation. When such recipients receive normal bone marrow cells from allogenic donors, the immunocompetent, T cells present in the donor marrow recognizes the recipient's HLA antigen as foreign antigen and react against them. Both CD4+ and CD8+T cells recognize and attack host tissues. In clinical practice GVH can be so severe that bone marrow transplants are done only between ILIA matched donor and recipient. Acute GVH disease occurs within days to weeks after allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although any organ may be affected, the major clinical manifestation results from involvement of the immune system and epithelia of the skin, liver and intestines. Involvement of the skin in GVH disease is manifested by a generalized rash leading to desquamation in severe cases. Destruction of small bile ducts gives rise to jaundice and mucosal ulceration of the gut results in bloody diarrhoea. Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease. The immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's immune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant."}]}

Ans. D: Decreased AFP level Alpha-fetoprotein is made in the pa of the womb called the yolk sac and in the fetal liver, and some amount of AFP gets into the mother's blood. In neural tube defects, the skin of the fetus is not intact and so larger amounts of AFP is measured in the mother's blood. In Down syndrome, the AFP is decreased in the mother's blood, presumably because the yolk sac and fetus are smaller than usual. Estriol is a hormone produced by the placenta, using ingredients made by the fetal liver and adrenal gland. Estriol is decreased in the Down syndrome pregnancy. This test may not be included in all screens, depending on the laboratory. Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone is produced by the placenta, and is used to test for the presence of pregnancy. A specific smaller pa of the hormone, called the beta subunit, is increased in Down syndrome pregnancies. Inhibin A is a protein secreted by the ovary, and is designed to inhibit the production of the hormone FSH by the pituitary gland. The level of inhibin A is increased in the blood of mothers of fetuses with Down syndrome. PAPP-A, which stands for pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, is produced by the covering of the newly feilized egg. In the first trimester, low levels of this protein are seen in Down syndrome pregnancies. It is impoant to keep in mind that even the best combination of ultrasound findings and other variables is only predictive and not diagnostic. For true diagnosis, the chromosomes of the fetus must be examined. Amniocentesis is usually carried out between the 14th and 18th week of pregnancy. CVS is usually carried out between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy."}]}

RDA is expected to meet the needs of 97 to 98% of the individuals, while it is not known what percentage of individuals arc covered by the adequate intake. o The adequate intake does not bear a consistent relationship to the EAR or the RDA because it is set without being able to estimate the average requirement.

The patient most likely has a type V hyperlipopro­teinemia, which is associated with eruptive xanthomas secondary to increased triacylglycerol. Type V hyperli­poproteinemia is a combination of type I, characterized by elevated chylomicrons, and type IV, characterized by increased very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Diabetic ketoacidosis and alcoholism are two of the most common factors that promote type V hyperlipo­proteinemia. The absence of insulin characteristic of diabetic ketoacidosis decreases capillary lipoprotein li­pase activity, so neither chylomicrons nor VLDL are properly metabolized in the liver. The increased triac­ylglycerol concentration that results from the accumu­lation of chylomicrons and VLDL in the blood pro­duces a turbid specimen. Because chylomicrons have the lowest density, they form a turbid supranate in plasma left at 4°C overnight. The density of VLDL is slightly higher than that of chylomicrons, so it forms a turbid infranate. Presence of a supranate and in­franate, as in this case, indicates type V hyperlipopro­teinemia. A supranate without an infranate occurs in type I hyperlipoproteinemia, and an infranate without a supranate occurs in type IV hyperlipoproteinemia. Another feature of type V disease is hyperchylomicro­nemia. Clinical features include eruptive xanthomas caused by the deposition of triacylglycerol in the sub­cutaneous tissue.

Immunodeficiency is a frequent accompaniment of GVH disease the immunodeficiency may be a result of prior treatment, myeloablative preparation for the graft, a delay in repopulation of the recipient's immune system and attack on host's inunune cells by grafted lymphocytes. Affected individuals are profoundly immunosuppressed and are easy prey to infections. Although many different types of organisms may infect patients, infection with cytomegalovirus is paicularly impoant."}]}

Males are affected more than the females. Achalasia cardia is a motor disorder of the esophageal smooth muscle in which the LES does not relax normally with swallowing, & the esophageal body undergoes nonperistaltic contractions. (Primary peristalsis is absent or reduced). The pathogenesis of Achlasia is poorly understood. It involves:# Neurogenic degeneration either idiopathic or due to infection. The degenerative changes are either intrinsic (degeneration of ganglion cells of Aurebach'smyentric plexus) or extrinsic (extraesophagealvagus nerve or the dorsal motor nucleus of vagus)# Pharmacologic studies suggest dysfunction of inhibitory neurons containing nitric oxideand vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in the distal esophagus (LES). The cholinergic innervation of the LES is intact or affected only in advanced disease. Asa result of the abnormality, the LES fails to relax, primary peristalsis is absent in esophagus which dilates. As the disease progresses the esophagus becomes massively dilated and tortuous.Clinical findings# Both sexes are equally affected # May develop at any age but peak years are from 30 to 60.# Classical clinical symptom is progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Dysphagia is worsened by emotional stress and hurried eating.# Regurgitation and Pulmonary aspiration occur because of retention of large volumes of saliva and ingested food in the esophagus.# Esophagitis with ulceration may occur with chronic retention of food.# Pain is infrequent in classical achlasia but a variant called vigrous achlasia is characterized by chest pain and esophageal spasms that generate non-propuloine high-pressure waves in the body of the esophagus.Diagnosis# Chest x-ray - shows absence of gastric air bubble, an air-fluid level in the mediastinum in the upright position representing retained food in oesophagus.# Barium swallow - shows dilated esophagus with tapering narrowing in the terminal end of esophagus described as 'birds' beak' appearance. Fluoroscopy shows loss of normal peristalsis in the lower two thirds of esophagus.# Endoscopy may be done to rule out any secondary cause of achlasiaeg. carcinoma, stricture at LES.Manometry# It's the most confrmatory investigation# it is able to distinguish between various forms of motor disorders of esophagus# Manometric characteristics of Achlasia* Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation (< 75% relaxation)* Elevated LES pressure* Loss of primary peristaltic waves in the esophageal body, but disorganized muscular activity may be present. Increased intraesophageal baseline pressure relative to gastric baseline. Cholecystokinin (CCK) which normally causes a fall in the sphincter pressure, paradoxically causes contraction of the LES (the CCK test). This paradoxical response occurs because, in achlasia the neurally transmitted inhibitory effect of CCK is absent owing to the loss of inhibitory neurons."}]}

Nearly 1 to 20% of people who receive a solid organ transplant develop a lymphoma. - Lymphomas have also been repoed (though less .frequently) after bone-marrow transplants .for other disorders. Why does it happen? - Post-transplant lymphomas are almost always related to infection by the Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). - Infection by the Epstein Barr Virus causes a transformation of B-cells which becomes cancerous. In normal individuals other cells of the immune system can tackle the EBV infection, but for organ transplants high doses of drugs that suppress the immune system must be administered. With nothing to control the infection, the chances of developing lymphomas increase. The two main factors that determine the chances of getting lymphoma are: How much immunosuppressive treatment is required - The more the immunosuppression, the more the chances of EBV infection. The status of EBV serology of the recipient of the transplant - If this individual has previously been infected by EBV the chances are that the body remembers the infection and the blood already has called antibodies that can identify and kill the virus. Clinical features Post-transplant lymphomas are usually different .from the usual Non-Hodgkin lymphomas. While most patients have involvement mainly of lymph nodes, other organs are very commonly affected as well. These include the brain, lungs and the intestines. The transplanted organ can also get involved. Treatment Whenever possible, immunosuppressive treatment has to be reduced or stopped. In those who have small and localized disease, surgery or radiation may be attempted. If not, the first line of treatment is usually Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets lymphoma cells. Only when this. fails is chemotherapy attempted. Chemotherapy is deferred until necessary as in paially immunosuppressed individuals, chemotherapy may fuher increase the risk of infections. In those who develop lymphomas after bone marrow transplants, donor leukocyte transfusions can be highly effective. Prognosis of Post transplant lymphomas In general, non-Hodgkin lymphomas occurring after organ transplants have a poorer outcome than other NHLs. Around 60-80% of the victims ultimately succumb to their lymphoma. Involvement of brain has poor prognosis"}]}

Ans. b. Prevented by giving warm fluids Hypothermia during anesthesia can be prevented by giving warm fluids. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Mild hypothermia is extremely common during anesthesia and surgery. The physiological effects of hypothermia may have significant potential for detrimental effects on patient well-being. Major consequences of inadveent hypothermia include morbid myocardial events, reduced resistance to surgical wound infection, impaired coagulation, delayed recovery, and postoperative shivering. Heat loss occurs primarily from the skin of a patient to the environment through several processes, including radiation, conduction and convection, and evaporation. Of these, radiation is most significant and accounts for --60% of total heat loss. Drug metabolism can be markedly decreased by hypothermia. Although hypothermia is generally regarded as deleterious, it can be beneficial in some situations. Hypothermia decreases the overall metabolic rate by 8% per degC to about half the normal rate at 28degC. Oxygen demand drops and those tissues that have high oxygen consumption normally, such as brain and hea, have a propoionally greater reduction of oxygen use. This allows aerobic metabolism to continue through greater periods of compromised oxygen supply, thereby reducing the production of anaerobic byproducts such as superoxide radicals and lactate. Hypothermia During Anesthesia Hypothermia lowers intracranial pressures and cerebral perfusion pressure. Warming of fluids can only help to minimize heat loss. Warm fluids are probably of benefit only when large amounts are administered for fluid replacement."}]}

Cyanoacrylate tissue adhesives are liquid monomers that undergo an exothermic reaction on exposure to moisture (eg, on the skin surface), changing to polymers that form a strong tissue bond. When applied to a laceration, the polymer binds the wound edges together to allow normal healing of the underlying tissue. Compared with wounds closed with sutures, the tensile strength of wounds closed by tissue adhesives is less at the time of initial application, but equalizes by one week post-repair. Advantages:. Less painful application, and sometimes no need for local anesthetic injection More rapid application and repair time Cosmetically similar results at 12 months post-repair \tWaterproof barrier Antimicrobial properties Better acceptance by patients No need for suture removal or follow-up.

AIDS and HIV Infection with HIV-1 is associated with a progressive decrease of the CD4+ T cell count and an increase in viral load, the level of HIV in the blood. The stage of infection can be determined by measuring the patient's CD4+ T cell count and viral load. The stages of HIV infection are acute infection (also known as primary infection), latency and AIDS. Acute infection lasts for several weeks and may include symptoms such as fever, lymphadenopathy, pharyngitis, rash, myalgia, malaise, and mouth and esophageal sores. The latency stage involves few or no symptoms and can last anywhere from two weeks to twenty years or more, depending on the individual. AIDS, the final stage of HIV infection, is defined by low CD4+ T cell counts (fewer than 200 per microliter), various oppounistic infections, cancers and other conditions. When CD4+ T cell numbers decline below a critical level of 200 cells per uL, cell-mediated immunity is lost, and infections with a variety of oppounistic microbes appear. The first symptoms often include moderate and unexplained weight loss, recurring respiratory tract infections (such as sinusitis, bronchitis, otitis media, pharyngitis), prostatitis, skin rashes, and oral ulcerations. Common oppounistic infections and tumors, most of which are normally controlled by robust CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity then sta to affect the patient. Typically, resistance is lost early on to oral Candida species and to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which leads to an increased susceptibility to oral candidiasis (thrush) and tuberculosis. Later, reactivation of latent herpes viruses may cause worsening recurrences of herpes simplex eruptions, shingles, Epstein-Barr virus-induced B-cell lymphomas, or Kaposi's sarcoma. Pneumonia caused by the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii is common and often fatal. In the final stages of AIDS, infection with cytomegalovirus (another herpes virus) or Mycobacterium avium complex is more prominent."}]}

In case one of the trochanters has moved proximally the lines will converge on that side.. Perkin's line :. When the congenital Dislocation of hip is mild in nature, the perkins lines are drawn to detect it. A horizontal line is drawn through the triradiate cartilage and a vertical line is drawn down from the outer edge of the acetabulum on both sides. The upper femoral epiphyses normally lies medial to the vertical line and below the horizontal line. But in congenital dislocation of hip the epiphyses will lie on the outer aspect of the vertical line and above the horizontal line.. Bryants triangle :. The patient lies supine. The tips of the greater trochanter and ASIS on both sides are marked. A perpendicular is dropped from each ASIS on to the bed. From the tip of the greater trochanter, another perpendicular is dropped on to the first one. The tips of the greater trochanter are joined to the ASIS on the respective side. This forms a triangle ABC. The side BC of the triangle measures supra trochanteric shortening of the hip."}]}

The papillary muscles are connected to the mitral valve leaflets by the chordae tendinae. When there is rupture of the chordae tendinae or the papillary muscle itself, the mitral valve is unable to function properly, resulting in mitral regurgitation. Because this is an acute process, accommodation does not occur, resulting in acute pulmonary edema. Edema predominantly affecting the right upper lobe can be seen if the jet of regurgitant blood is directed into the right superior pulmonary vein, which drains the right upper lobe. The left atrium will enlarge over time in the setting of mitral valve regurgitation due to the increased volume of blood that is directed into the left atrium during systole. However, this change occurs over time and will not be seen in the setting of acute papillary muscle rupture. The left ventricle will enlarge oveime in the setting of mitral valve regurgitation because it receives an increased volume of blood from the left atrium - both the volume of blood returning from the lung as well as the regurgitant volume of blood through the mitral valve. As with left atrial enlargement, left ventricular enlargement will occur over time but will not be seen in the setting of acute papillary muscle rupture. Pericardial effusion can occur in the setting of an acute myocardial infarction due to inflammation of the pericardium. Dressler syndrome, thought to be an autoimmune inflammatory response to myocardial neo-antigens, is not an acute process and, when present, occurs several weeks following a myocardial infarction.

Pseudopolyps (inflammatory polyps) can be seen in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis In ulcerative colitis, the distribution of these pseudopolyps can be diffuse but in Crohn's disease, the distribution cannot be diffuse because a classic feature of crohn's disease is the sharp demarcation of diseased bowel segments from the adjacent uninvolved bowel. When multiple bowel segments are involved the intervening bowel is essentially normal (skip lesions).. Mucosal edema - The hallmark of both ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease is mucosal inflammation and chronic mucosal damage. So mucosal edema is a feature of both of these diseases. - The important point is that while in Ulcerative colitis these processes are limited to mucosa or submucosal, in crohn's disease these processes extend beyond the mucosa and submucosa and involves the entire wall..

Phenotype* To explain these terms, let us have a simple example, which we have learnt in our school. A sweet pea plant can either grow tall or short. The plant grows tall if the plant has TT or Tt and the plant remains dwarf if the plant has tt. In this example, plant being tall and plant being short are the two phenotypes. Hence phenotypes are the external manifestations of a genome. Genotypes are genetic expressions of a trait. Just by looking at something, if we can comment whether the plant can grow tall or if the plant has to remain dwarf is called as genotypes. So there are three genotypes - TT, Tt, tt. What are alleles? T is one allele and t is another allele. So alleles are alternating forms of the same gene. Genotype is the genetic expression of a trait* Phenotype is the physical expression of a trait* Alleles are alternating forms of the same gene - in the sense they differ by a few nucleotide sequences so that aminoacid sequences of the polypeptide chain gets affected minimally - so that the function of the protein gets affected either qualitatively or quantitatively. Polymorphism is presence of multiple alleles at a single locus giving rise to multiple phenotypes, provided the prevalence of the alleles in a general population is more than 1%# For example, hair colour - we do not say only black hair is normal, various shades of brown and even white hair in a blonde person is normal. This is because of the presence of multiple alleles - an allele produces black pigment, many alleles to produces various shades of brown and then an allele which does not produce pigment - causing blonde hair.# In this example the last allele which has failed to produce the respective protein should be considered as a defective allele. But we consider it as a normal allele based on prevalence. As prevalence of the allele which can not produce the pigment is more than 1% in the general population, we call it as a normal allele."}]}

Ans. c. 4th -- 6th ribs Reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the literature in relation to rib fractures in adults Rib fractures following CPR in adults are quite common - 30 to 60% of prospective post-moem studies. Post-CPR rib fractures are often bilateral. The site of rib fracture is dependent on: the position of the hands; force used; and method of chest compression (manual or device-assisted). The vast majority (90%+) offractures occur in ribs 2 to 7; fractures in the bony pas of rib numbers 1 and 8 to 10 are possible but probably very rare; it is difficult to see how fractures can occur in rib numbers 11 and 12 following standard manual CPR. The vast majority of fractures (90%+) occur in the anterior third of the bony pa of the rib, some occur in the middle third but - following standard manual CPR - none in the posterior third of the bony pa of the rib. Posterior rib fractures occur following automated band-type CPR. Lateral fractures i.e. those occurring between the anterior and posterior axillary lines, do occur after standard CPR. If a fracture is noted in rib numbers 10 to 12 or in the posterior third of the bony pa of a rib, then non-resuscitation trauma should be suspected. Chest x-ray is unreliable as a diagnostic tool for detecting rib fractures. CT is better than x-ray and may complement the post-moem detection of rib fractures.

Transport of alanine from muscle to liver (glucose-alanine cycle) has two functions :-Providing substrate for giuconeogenesis - Transport of ammonia (NH4+) to liver for urea synthesis. During the first few days of starvation, there is a rapid breakdown of muscle protein, providing aminoacids for giuconeogenesis. The most important gluconeogenic amino acid is alanineQ (through glucose-alanine cycle). Alanine is released due to increased muscle protein breakdown and is transported to liver for giuconeogenesis (glucose alanine cycle). The other important gluconeogenic amino acid in starvation is glutamine. After some weeks of starvation, the rate of muscle breakdown decreases due to decreased need of glucose as a fuel for brain which has began using ketone bodies as a source of energy'. However, when the triacylglycerol stores are completely exhaused, muscle proteins once again enter in a stage of rapid depletion due to protein breakdown,o Alanine transport from muscle to liver has an important additional role, beside giuconeogenesis. Because muscle is incapable of synthesizing urea, most of the ammonia formed by protein catabolism is transferred to pyruvate to form alanine by transamination. Alanine is transported to liver where amino group of alanine is removed to form urea and the resulting pyruvate is converted to glucose by giuconeogenesis. Thus, sources of alanine release from muscle are (i) Degradation of protein (ii) Transamination of pyruvate. Besides alanine, lactate produced in muscles by anerobic use of glucose, also seves as a substrate for giuconeogenesis - cori cycle or lactic acid cycle"}]}

The most common is a joint origin of the upper two branches as either a coeliac mesenteric trunk or a lienohepaticomesenteric trunk with a separate left gastric artery. Accessory or replaced branches to the upper abdominal viscera are more common. Accessory anastomotic vessels between the origin of the coeliac trunk and superior mesenteric artery are rare.c. The inferior mesenteric artery always arises separately, however, replaced, accessory or anastomotic vessels occasionally arise from the proximal superior mesenteric artery or its branches and contribute to the arterial supply to the proximal territory of the inferior mesenteric artery.d. The coeliac trunk and its branches supplies the gastrointestinal tract from the distal third of the oesophagus to the mid part of the duodenum and all derived adenexae (liver, biliary tree, spleen, dorsal pancreas, greater omentum and lesser omentum).e.

Neither architectural pattern nor cell pleomorphism is a good predictor of the malignant potential of carcinoid tumors. In general, this rule applies to most of endocrine tumors, in which histologic features and biologic behavior do not often correlate with one another.

There is no association to the husband's URI. Herpes gestationis is a pruritic blistering dermatologic disorder unique to pregnancy. It is not associated with past or present herpes infection. The onset is generally later in pregnancy (second trimester or later). The distribution involves the abdomen or extremities but may be generalized. It is thought to be an autoimmune condition triggered by pregnancy, with antibodies against hemidesmosomal proteins. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Grave's disease, or pernicious anemia. Tunzi et al. describe some of the major pregnancy-specific skin conditions, which include pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy, prurigo of pregnancy, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, pemphigoid gestationis, impetigo herpetiformis, and pruritic folliculitis of pregnancy. The majority of skin conditions resolve postpartum and require only symptomatic treatment.

CO2 washout PDA in preterm neonate o In previous explanations I have explained that chances of spontaneous closure of PDA are higher in premature infants as there is no structural abnormality. However, you should keep in mind that this fact is true when we are comparing the spontaneous closure of PDA between term and pre-term neonate. Overall, the percentage of spontaneous closure of PDA in preterm neonate is very low. To avoid confusion, I am explaining following facts in brief:? 1) Normal neonate :- Ductus aeriosus closes functionally within about 15 hours of bih. 2) PDA in term (mature) neonate :- The persistence of ductus aeriosus beyond 24 hours after bih is considered as PDA in term neonate. Spontaneous closure of PDA does not usually occur because PDA results from structural abnormality. 3) PDA in pre-term (pre-mature) neonate :- The ductus aeriosus in pre-term neonate is not as responsive to increased oxygen content as it is in term neonate. However, there is no structural abnormality. i) Chances of spontaneous closure are very less (compared to normal term neonate). ii)Chances of spontaneous closure are more than the term-neonate with PDA. However, in premature neonate, where hypoxic pulmonary disease is commonplace, the ductus being sensitive to hypoxia, remains open. o So, it is very unlikely that spontaneous closure of PDA will occur in pre-term neonate. But chances are more when compared to term neonate with PDA (not normal term neonate in which ductus aeriosus closes within 15 hours of bih). Manifestations of PDA in pre-term neonate 1) Apnea for unexplained reasons in an infant recovering from RDS; 2) A hyperdynamic precordium, bounding peripheral pulses, wide pulse pressure, and a continuous or systolic murmur with or without extension into diastole or an apical diastolic murmur, multiple clicks resembling the shaking of dice; 3) Carbon dioxide retention; 4) Increasing oxygen dependence; 5) X-ray evidence of cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vascular markings; and 6) Hepatomegaly o Increased pulmonary blood flow and compromised ventricular function accompanying dropping pulmonary resistance in the setting of a PDA is a significant risk factor for pulmonary hemorrhage. o The greatest risk factor for NEC is prematurity. Any etiology which leads on to hemodynamic or hypoxic insult predisposes to NEC. PDA is common in preterm infants and it definitely causes hemodynamic stress and is a risk factor for development of NEC."}]}

In shotgun it is cylinderical. Base is of brass and rest of it is of cardboard or plastic. In rifled weapons, it is tapering and whole of it is made of brass or steel.# Center of base has percussion cap (detonator cap) which has sensitive composition, i.e. primer, consisting of potassium chlorate, antimony sulphide, mercury fulminate, barium nitrite, lead peroxide or tetrazene.# In all weapons, after firing, the cartridge case remains in the barrel and it is to be taken out manually (shotgun, revolvers, rifle) or it is ejected out automatically, e.g. in pistals.2) Propellent (gun powder)# It propels the projectile (missile) forward. It is composed of black powder or smokeless powder in the form of grains, pellets, thin cylindrical cords or flakes. Its ignition results in formation of expanding hot gases under pressure which (gas pressure) propels the projectile (missile) by providing it necessary muzzle velocity and striking energy.# The classical gun powder is known as black powder, consists of charcol (15%), Sulphur (10%), and potassium nitrate (75%). Depending on fineness, the black gun powder is designated as FG, FFG, FFFG. etc. (F = fineness). Pyrodex is another gun powder with same components, but with different ratios.# Black gun powder produces smoke, i.e. It is smoke producing powder. Smokeless powder, in addition to black powder, has nitrocellulose (single base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine (double base), or nitrocellulose plus nitroglycerine plus nitroguanidine (triple base). Semi smokeless powder has 80% black powder and 20% smokeless powder (nitrocellulose).3) Projectile (missile)# Projectile is an object propelled by force of rapidly burning gases. In shotgun these are lead shots and pellets (recently steel is also used instead of lead) and in rifled weapons (pistal, rifle, revolver), these are bullets. Tip of the bullet is knwon as nose.4) Wads# Wads are present only in the cartridge of a shot gun. Wad can be made of paper, left, card board, or plastic. These are circular disc of various thicknesses, used to adjust the contents of a shotgun cartridge.# Felt wad (wad made of felt) is imprignated with grease and this lubricates the bore (inside of barrel)."}]}

The mature or adult swallow pattern appears in some normal children as early as age 3 but is not present in the majority until about age 6 and is never achieved in 10% to 15% of a typical population.  Tongue thrust swallowing in older patients superficially resembles the infantile swallow and sometimes children or adults who place the tongue between the anterior teeth are spoken of as having a retained infantile swallow. This is clearly incorrect. Only brain damaged children retain a truly infantile swallow in which the posterior part of the tongue has little or no role .Because coordinated movements of the posterior tongue and elevation of the mandible tend to develop before protrusion of the tongue tip between the incisor teeth disappears, what is called “tongue thrusting” in young children is often a normal transitional stage in swallowing. During the transition from an infantile to a mature swallow, a child can be expected to pass through a stage in which the swallow is characterized by muscular activity to bring the lips together, separation of the posterior teeth, and forward protrusion of the tongue between the teeth.

Polymorphonuclear leucocytosis in C.S.F. suggests meningeal involvement Spread of infection and immune response in lyme disease Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans the bite of ixodes tick vector Borrelia burgdorferi is inoculated in the skin, where local replication takes place locally and outward migration in the dermis occurs. Days to week after the tick bite, hematogenous dissemination to secondary sites (like joints, hea eye, nervous system) takes place. If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of antiBorrelia burgodorferi antibodies by the immune system. The following mechanisms have been described - i) Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. - This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish the.infection. ii) Once inside the body, Borrelia burgdorferi become; a stealth invader i.e., it changes shape. - In the tick and mice which host the bacterium through most of its life cycle, the bacterium has a thick cell wall and spiral shape. If it maintains its thick cell wall and its spiral shape, immune system can control infection. However, in the human body, it can shed its cell wall and can take a different shape. When under attack from immune system, it simply changes shape so it is not recognized. iii) Borrelia burgdorferi produces antigenic variation in a \"cell surface lipoprotein VIsE\", during the course of infection - The VIsE system presents a challenge to immune system because after an immune response is generated to one version of VISE protein, a different version is quickly produced. By using this type of antigenic variation, B. burgdorferi can escape the adaptive immune system.

Tibiofibular Joint I. Six types of synol joints are: Hinge Ball-and-socket Pivot Condyloid (angular or ellipsoidal) Plane (gliding) Saddle. - The elbow is an example of a hinge joint. Here, the convex and concave aiculating bones allow movement along one plane, similar to a door. -The shoulder and hip are the only ball-and-socket joints in the body. In this type of joint, one bone has a spherical head that aiculates with a corresponding concavity. This joint frees the joint to move in many directions. - In a pivot joint, one round-shaped aiculating bone fits within a corresponding depression on another bone. This joint allows one bone to rotate against the other. An example is the radioulnar joint (joint of the radius and ulna) in the forearm. - In a condyloid (angular) joint, one bone has an oval aiculating head that rests within an oval concavity. This joint permits angular movement of the bones. The metacarpophalangeal joint (junction between the metacarpals and phalanges) of the hand are examples of condyloid joints - Plane joints have two flat bones joined. The sole movement of the bones is sho gliding motions. An example of this joint is the intearsal joint (junction between the tarsal bones) of the feet. Saddle joint bones have convex and concave surfaces similar to a saddle. This joint allows the joint to move in many directions. The carpometacarpal joint of the thumb is an example saddle joint. II. As their name implies, amphiahrosis joints (slightly movable joints) have limited movement. The two types of amphiahrosis joints are: Syndesmosis (fibrous) Symphysis (cailaginous). - A Syndesmosis joint occurs when two bones join by a section of cailage. The junction between the tibia and fibula is an example. A symphysis joint forms when two bones fuse by a fibrocailage pad. Typical symphysis joints are between the pubic symphysis (pubic bones in the pelvis), and in the veebral column between individual veebrae. Interveebral discs act as weight-bearing shock absorbers for walking, jumping, and lifting. III. An immovable joint is called a synahrosis. The two types of this joint are: Sutures Gomphoses. - Sutures are joined by sho fibers of dense fibrous connective tissue and are in the skull. - The single example of a gomphosis joint is the teeth sitting within their sockets. IV. An example of a bony fusion joint is the fusion of the three bones forming a coxa (hip bone): the ilium, ischium, and pubis."}]}

K+ \"RMP is mainly due to difference of concentrations ofK+ ions in ECF and ICF\". -- Chaudhari* The cell membrane is selectively permeable. Due to presence of potassium leak channels K+ ions are freely permeable but permeability of Na+ is much less. In the generation of RMP, following sequence of events occur: -i) K+ diffuses out of cell along its concentration gradient (K+ concentration is very high inside the cells and very low in ECF).ii) The diffusion of K+ produces an intracellular negativity (due to non-diffusibleprotein anion in the cells) which is not nullified by the diffusion of Na+ in the opposite direction (membrane is impermeable to Na+) or diffusion of Cl- in same direction (Cl- concentration is already very high in ECF in comparison to ICF).iii) So, intracellular negativity is produced which opposes outward diffusion of K+ and when the equilibrium is reached, the inward force on K+ due to electrical gradient balances outward force on K+ due to concentation gradient.iv) Finally, at equilibrium inner side of cell is negatively charged with respect to outer side, and resting membrane potential is produced. So, the RMP is principally due to concentration difference (chemical difference) of K+ in ECF and ICF. In neurons, the resting membrane potential is usually about -70 mV, which is close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Here, it is worth noting that RMP is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ but the value of RMP is exactly same as equilibrium potential of Cl~. It is because other ions also diffuse through membrane, though their effect is very little."}]}

Corrosive injuries of the esophagus most frequently occur in young children due to accidental ingestion of strong alkaline cleaning agents. Significant esophageal injury occurs in 15% of patients with no oropharyngeal injury, while 70% of patients with oropharyngeal injury have no esophageal damage. Signs of airway injury or imminent obstruction warrant close observation and possibly tracheostomy. The risk of adding injury, particularly in a child, makes esophagoscopy contraindicated in the opinion of most surgeons. Administration of oral \"antidotes\" is ineffective unless given within moments of ingestion; even then, the additional damage potentially caused by the chemical reactions of neutralization often makes use of them unwise. A barium esophagogram is usually done within 24 h unless evidence of perforation is present. In most reports, steroids in conjunction with antibiotics reduce the incidence of formation of strictures from about 70% to about 15%. Vomiting should be avoided, if possible, to prevent further corrosive injury and possible aspiration. It is probably wise to avoid all oral intake until the full extent of injury is ascertained.The most helpful ECG finding is the presence of a new right bundle branch block, which occurs because of damage to the anterior portion of the interventricular septum; ST-segment and T-wave changes and even the development of new Q waves may be seen. CPK-MB fractions are useful if they are positive; however, frequent false negatives may be seen because of the release of CPK-MM from other contused organs, such as the pectoralis muscles, which can dilute the cardiac CPK-MB to nondiagnostic levels. Echocardiography may be helpful, but the right ventricle is often poorly visualized. Radionuclide angiography is most useful because it suggests the degree of myocardial impairment caused by decreased compliance.Therapy of myocardial contusion is directed at inotropic support of the ventricle; usually, the coronary arteries are intact after the injury and so there is little role for coronary vasodilators and less for coronary artery bypass grafting."}]}

Somatosensory evoked potential (SEP or SSEP) is the electrical activity of the brain that results from the stimulation of touch. SEP tests measure that activity and are a useful, noninvasive means of assessing somatosensory system functioning. By combining SEP recordings at different levels of the somatosensory pathways, it is possible to assess the transmission of the afferent volley from the periphery up to the coex. SEP components include a series of positive and negative deflections that can be elicited by viually any sensory stimuli. For example, SEPs can be obtained in response to a brief mechanical impact on the fingeip or to air puffs. However, SEPs are most commonly elicited by bipolar transcutaneous electrical stimulation applied on the skin over the trajectory of peripheral nerves of the upper limb (e.g., the median nerve) or lower limb (e.g., the posterior tibial nerve), and then recorded from the scalp. In general, somatosensory stimuli evoke early coical components (N25, P60, N80), generated in the contralateral primary somatosensory coex (S1), related to the processing of the physical stimulus attributes. About 100 ms after stimulus application, additional coical regions are activated, such as the secondary somatosensory coex (S2), and the posterior parietal and frontal coices, marked by a parietal P100 and bilateral frontal N140. SEPs are routinely used in neurology today to confirm and localize sensory abnormalities, to identify silent lesions and to monitor changes during surgical procedures. It is done mostly under General Anaesthesia to monitor neural pathway."}]}

EmphysemaPathogenesis of Emphysema The most accepted theory in the pathogenesis of emphysema is protease - antiprotease mechanism which is responsible in the pathogenesis of two common forms of emphysema, i.e. centriacinar and panacinar.o The alveolar wall destruction results from an imbalance between proteases (mainly elastase) and antiproteases in the lung.o Proteases (elastase) cause destruction of alveolar wall, while antiproteases prevent this damage.o acantitrypsin is the major antiprotease (antielastase) secreted by neutrophils during inflammation.Pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemao Panacinar emphysema is associated with congenital deficiency of arantinypsin.o This results in unchecked overactivity of neutrophil elastase that causes destruction of alveolar wall.o As occantitrypsin is deficient throughout the acinus, the acini are uniformly involved from the respiratory bronchiole to the terminal blind alveoli.o Neutrophils are the major cells in the pathogenesis of panacinar emphysemaPathogenesis of centriacinar emphysemao Centriacinar emphysema is associated with smoking.o Nicotine acts as a direct chemoattractant for neutrophils and macrophages.So, in centriacinar emphysema, both neutrophils and macrophages play central role.Smoking enhances activity of neutrophil and macrophage elastase.o Macrophage elastase is not inhibited by a1-antitrypsin and indeed can proteolytically digest this antiprotease.Beside protease - antiprotease mechanism, oxidant - antioxidant imbalance also plays an impoant role in the pathogenesis of smoking related emphysema.o Normally, the lung contains a healthy complement of antioxidants (superoxide dismutase, glutathione).o Tobacco smoke contains abundant reactive oxygen species (free radicals) which deplete these antioxidant mechanisms.o Free radicals cause tissue damage as well as they inactivate occantitrypsin, resulting in functional acantitrypsin deficiency even in patients without enzyme deficiency.Why smoking related emphysema involves centriacinar poion ?The impaction of smoke paicles occurs predominantly at the bifurcation of respiratory bronchioles, resulting in the influx of neutrophils and macrophages, both of which secrete proteases. An increase in protease activity localized in the centriacinar region, together with the smoke induced oxidative damage, causes the centriacinar pattern of emphysema that is seen in smokers."}]}

Ludwig's Angina is a rapidly spreading cellulitis of the floor of the mouth which involves submandibular space secondary to dental infection. Submandibular space is divided into sublingual space (above the mylohyoid) and submaxillary space (below the mylohyoid muscle) Bacteriology: Mixed infections involving both aerobes and anaerobes are common like, alpha haemolytic streptococci, staphylococci bacteriodes and E. coll. H. influenzae is a rare cause. Clinical features: In Ludwig's angina, there is usually cellulitis of the tissue rather than frank abscess. Marked difficulty in swallowing (odynophagia). Varying degrees of trisumus. On involvement of sublingual space, floor of the mouth is swollen, edematous and tongue seems to be pushed up and back. On involvement of the submaxillary space, the submental and submandibular regions become swollen and tender and impa woody-hard feel.Tongue is progressively pushed upward and backward threatening the airway. Laryngeal edema may appear, if it spreads to parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal space. Treatment: Systemic antibiotics I and D should be postponed as long as possible because pus is seldom found. Tracheostomy is required if airway is endangered. If incision and drainage for Ludwig's angina is done under GA-there are increased chances of aspiration and shock as tongue is pushed up and back in Ludwig angina."}]}

Single breath N2 method Examiner is simply asking that how will you measure anatomical dead space. When air is breathed in, only the air that reaches the alveoli paicipates in gas exchange. The air in the airways (Trachea, bronchi) is breathed out unchanged as air in them does not paicipate in gaseous diffusion. Hence the airway space behaves as functionally dead so far as gas exhange is concerned. This is called 'anatomical dead space'. The volume of this space is 150 ml. That means only the first 350 ml of the 500 ml inspired with each breath (tidal volume) at rest mixes with the air in the alveoli. Conversely, with each expiration, the first 150 ml expired is gas that occupied the dead space, and only the last 350 ml is gas from the alveoli. So, normally dead space (Vd) : tidal volume (Vi) ratio is 0.30 (150: 500). Anatomical dead space is calculated by single-breath N2 method. About option 'C' Bohr equation is used to calculate physiological (total dead space). Normally, 350 ml of air enters the alveoli, with each breath. However, not all the air that enters the alveoli necessarily paicipates in alveolar gas exchange. In disease states, no diffusion (exchange) may take place between the gas in some of the alveoli and blood, and some of the alveoli may be overventilated. Such spaces in the alveoli constitues 'alveolar' dead space. The sum of anatomical dead space and alveolar dead space is called the 'physiological' dead space. Hence, the physiological dead space is the volume of inspired air, in airways (anatomical dead space) and in the alveoli (alveolar dead space), that does not paicipate in gaseous exchange. In healthy individuals, anatomical dead space and physiological dead space are identical because all the air entering into the alveoli paicipates in gaseous exchange (as alveolar diffusion, ventilation and perfusion are normal in healthy individuals)."}]}

All Tumors, benign or malignant, have two basic components →.  Proliferative neoplastic cells → constitute parenchyma. Supportive stroma → made up of connective tissue and blood vessels..  The name of tumor is usually based on the cell, e.g. smooth muscle cell tumor → leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma, skeletal muscle cell tumor rhabdomyosarcoma.. Benign tumors. In general, benign tumors are designed by attaching the suffix - oma, e.g tumor of fibroblasts → fibroma, tumor of cartilagenous cells → chondroma.. Malignant tumors. Malignant tumors arising in mesenchymal cell origin are usually called sarcoma, e.g. fibrosarcoma, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma. Malignant tumors of epithelial cell origin are called carcinoma..  Carcinoma may be further classified → one with glandular growth pattern, i.e. adenocarcinoma and the other one producing recognizable squamous cells of epithelium, i.e. squamous cell carcinoma..

Neuroblastoma, a highly malignant tumor of children, occurs along the distribution of the sympathetic nervous system. It is derived from ganglion cell precursors and thus usually causes an increased excretion of catecholamines and their metabolites. Because of its propensity to metastasize to bone and its histological resemblance to Ewing's sarcoma, its association with elevated catecholamine levels is a major factor in differential diagnosis.Renal stones occur in about half the cases of hyperparathyroidism. Other disorders sometimes associated with hyperparathyroidism include peptic ulcers, pancreatitis, and bone disease; central nervous system symptoms may also arise in connection with hyperparathyroidism. Occasionally, parathyroid adenomas occur in conjunction with neoplasms of other endocrine organs, a condition known as multiple endocrine adenomatosis.Cystic teratomas, or dermoid cysts, include endodermal, ectodermal, and mesodermal elements. They are characteristically cystic and contain poorly pigmented hair, sebaceous material, and occasionally teeth. Dermoid cysts occur in the gonads and central nervous system, as well as in the mediastinum. With rare exceptions, these lesions are benign.Thymomas are associated with myasthenia gravis, agammaglobulinemia, and red blood cell aplasia. These tumors are typically cystic and occur in the anterior mediastinum. Most thymic lesions associated with myasthenia gravis are hyperplastic rather than neoplastic.Persons afflicted with Hodgkin's disease have impaired cell-mediated immunity and are particularly susceptible to mycotic infections and tuberculosis. The severity of the immune deficiency correlates with the extent of the disease. The nodular sclerosing variant of primary mediastinal Hodgkin's disease is the most common type."}]}

Clomiphene citrate is a triphenylethylene; its two isomers, zuclomiphene (cis-clomiphene) and enclomiphene (trans-clomiphene), are a weak estrogen agonist and a potent antagonist, respectively. The incidence of multiple pregnancies is approximately 10%. Although clomiphene is effective in inducing ovulation in perhaps 75% of women, successful pregnancy ensues in only 40-50% of those who ovulate. Clomiphene also may be used to evaluate the male reproductive system because testosterone feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary is mediated to a large degree by estrogens formed from aromatization of the androgen. Enclomiphene is a more potent anti-oestrogenic isomer and the one primarily responsible for the ovulation-inducing actions of clomiphene citrate. Intrauterine insemination and clomiphene citrate increase pregnancy rate 3 times as compared to placebo.

Heme lies in the hydrophobic interior (pocket) of globin chain of hemoglobin and myoglobin. Polypeptide chain of myoglobin and all four polypeptide chains of hemoglobin have helical structure. Polypeptide subunits of hemoglobin are held together by hydrogen bonds, salt (ionic) bonds and Van der walls forces. Myoglobin has only one polypeptide chain, thus there is no question of bonding between subunits. However, this should not be confused that there is no bonds in myoglobin. Myoglobin has secondary and tertiary structure which are stabilized by non-covalent bonds. Polypeptide chain of myoglobin is compactly folded so that the non-polar (hydrophobic) amino acids lies in the interior forming hydrophobic bonds and polar (hydrophilic) amino acid on the exterior surface forming hydrogen and electrostatic (ionic bonds). So, compact structure of myoglobin is stabilized by hydrogen and ionic bonds as well as by the hydrophobic interactions. Similarly, Each polypeptide chain of hemoglobin is stabilized by hydrophobic bonds (in interior) and hydrogen and ionic (electrostatic) bonds (on exterior).

The work of Goldman and others has served to identify risk factors for perioperative myocardial infarction. The highest likelihood is associated with recent myocardial infarction: the more recent the event, the higher the risk up to 6 months. It should be noted, however, that the risk never returns to normal. A non-Q-wave infarction may not have destroyed much myocardium, but it leaves the surrounding area with borderline perfusion, thus the paicularly high risk of subsequent perioperative infarction. Evidence of congestive hea failure, such as jugular venous distention, or S3 gallop also carries a high risk, as does the frequent occurrence of ectopic beats. Old age (>70 years) and emergency surgery are risk factors independent of these others. Coronary revascularization by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) tends to protect against myocardial infarction. Smoking, diabetes, hypeension, and hyperlipidemia (all of which predispose to coronary artery disease) are surprisingly not independent risk factors, although they may increase the death rate should an infarct occur. The value of this information and data derived from fuher testing is that it identifies the patient who needs to be monitored invasively with a systemic aerial catheter and pulmonary aerial catheter. Most perioperative infarcts occur postoperatively when the third-space fluids return to the circulation, which increases the preload and the myocardial oxygen consumption.

Malonyl-CoA, the initial intermediate in fatty acid biosynthes is formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the fed state, is a potent inhibitor of CPT-I. Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (CPT-I) is the rate limiting enzyme in the process of beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Beta-oxidation is the process by which fatty acids, in the form of Acyl-CoA molecules, are broken down in mitochondria to generate Acetyl-CoA. Under normal conditions, acetyl-CoA is further oxidized in the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) to produce energy. However, if the amounts of acetyl-CoA generated in fatty-acid b-oxidation challenge the processing capacity of the TCA cycle or if activity in the TCA cycle is low due to low amounts of intermediates such as oxaloacetate, acetyl-CoA is then used instead in biosynthesis of ketone bodies via acetoacyl-CoA and b-hydroxy-b-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG- CoA).Beta-oxidation of fatty acids is caused when there is low blood glucose levels in the blood, after exhaustion of cellular carbohydrate stores, such as glycogen. In well fed state fatty acids are esterified.The entry of fatty acids into the oxidative pathway is regulated by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-I (CPT-I).In a well fed state the CPT-I activity is low, leading to depression of fatty acid oxidation. In state of starvation, CPT-I activity is high, leading to fatty acid oxidation.CPT-I is inhibited by Malonyl-CoA.Malonyl-CoA is the initial intermediate in fatty acid biosynthesis formed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the fed state.In well fed state, free fatty acids are nearly all esterified to acylglycerols.In starvation Acetyl-CoA carboxylase is inhibited directly by acyl-CoA, and malonyl-CoA decreases, releasing the inhibition of CPT-I and allowing more acyl-CoA to be beta-oxidized.Thus, beta-oxidation from free fatty acids is controlled by the CPT-I gateway into the mitochondria, and the balance of the free fatty acid uptake not oxidized is esterified.Role of Carnitine palmitoyl transferase I in fatty acid oxidation: The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to fatty acids. CPT-I helps in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondria."}]}

POST MASTECTOMY PAIN . The breast, axilla and upper are innervated by a variety of nerves; the lateral cutaneous branch of T2 (intercostobrachial nerve), T3 and T4 provide innervation to the anterior chest wall and upper back, the torso and nipple. Sympathetic innervation of the cutaneous structures of the breast is provided by the medial and lateral branches of the ventral ramus of 3rd to 6th intercostal nerves. While both nociceptive pain (due to damage of muscles and ligaments) and neuropathic pain can occur after surgery for breast cancer, neuropathic pain is more likely to persist after wound healing has occurred. . Four pain syndromes have been distinguished 1. Phantom breast pain is a painful (often knife-like or shooting) sensation that the removed breast is still present. 2. Intercostobrachial neuralgia: usually known as post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMP). Consists of pain in the axilla, medial upper arm and anterior chest wall and is often caused by nerve damage during axillary node dissection 3. Neuroma pain: can occur from scars from either mastectomy or lumpectomy but is more common if surgery is followed by radiotherapy. 4. Other nerve injury pain: can occur even if the intercostobrachial nerve is spared and is more common in breast reconstruction and implants. In Jung et also review, there were 21 studies with follow-up periods from 1-96 months (one study of 210 months), which revealed the following widely varying ranges of prevalence estimates:.

Transduction Transduction* The transfer of a portion of DNA from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage (virus). Bacteriophages are viruses that parasite bacteria and consist of nucleic acid core and a protein coat. Transduction may be1. Generalised - When it involves any segment of donor DNA2. Restricted - When a specific bacteriophage transduces only a particular genetic trait eg. prophage lambda in E coli K 12 (Gal +gene - Determines fermentation of galactose)* Transduction is not confined to transfer of chromosomal DNA, episomes and plasmid may also be transduced. The plasmid determining penicillin resistance in staphylococci are transferred from cell to cell by transduction. Transduction appears to be the most widespread mechanism of gene transfer among prokaryotes. Transduction is an excellent tool for the genetic mapping of bacteria. Transduction has been proposed as a method of genetic engineering in the treatment of some inborn errors of metabolism.Lysogenic conversion* In lysogenic conversion the phage DNA itself is the new genetic element as it becomes integrated with the bacterial host DNA with which it multiplies and is transferred to daughter cells, e.g. diptheriae corynebacterium.T ransformation* This is the transfer of genetic material through the agency of free DNA (May involve taking up of soluble DNA with host DNA and codes new species through the cell wall). Transformation was the first example of genetic exchange (horizontal gene transfer) in bacteria to have been discovered. It was demonstrated in Streptococcus pneumoniae by Griffith in 1928. Other organisms in which transformation has been studied are Bacillus, Haemophilus and BPH.Conjugation* Bacterial conjugation is the transfer of genetic material between bacteria through direct cell to cell contact or through a bridge- like connection between two cells. Conjugation is process where by a donor (male) bacterium makes physical contact with a recipient (female) bacterium. Donor status is determined by the presence of plasmid. This plasmid codes for specialized fimbria (sex pilus) and for self transfer. Sex pilus (conjugation tube) helps in transfer of genetic material from male bacterium to female bacterium. The plasmid is known as transfer factor (sex factor or fertility factor). Plasmid may be Rfactor, which codes for transferable multiple drug resistance. The DNA of the plasmid replicates during transfer so that each bacterium receives a copy - Recipient becomes donor and the donor retains its donor status.SummaryGene transfer in bacteriaa) Transformation-Transfer of genetic material through the agency of free DNA (may involve taking up soluble DNA fragments across their cell wall from other species).b) Transduction-Transfer of a portion ofDNA by bacteriophage (a virus).c) Conjugation-Transfer of genetic material by physical contact.d) Lysogenic conversion-Incorporation of phage DNA into host DNA."}]}

Veigo, 'a whirling or spinning movement' is a type of dizziness, where there is a feeling of motion when one is stationary. The symptoms are due to a dysfunction of the vestibular system in the inner ear. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting as well as difficulties standing or walking. The most common causes are benign paroxysmal positional veigo, concussion and vestibular migraine while less common causes include Meniere's disease and vestibular neuritis. Excessive consumption of ethanol (alcoholic beverages) can also cause notorious symptoms of veigo. A number of conditions that involve the central nervous system may lead to veigo including: migraine headaches, lateral medullary syndrome, multiple sclerosis Veigo is a sensation of spinning while stationary. Repetitive spinning, as in familiar childhood games, can induce sho-lived veigo by disrupting the ineia of the fluid in the vestibular system Veigo is classified into either peripheral or central depending on the location of the dysfunction of the vestibular pathway Peripheral: Veigo caused by problems with the inner ear or vestibular system is called \"peripheral\", \"otologic\" or \"vestibular\". - The most common cause is benign paroxysmal positional veigo (BPPV) but other causes include Meniere's disease, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis and visual veigo. - Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient veigo if they involve the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures). - Motion sickness is sometimes classified as a cause of peripheral veigo. Central: If veigo arises from the balance centers of the brain, it is usually milder, and has accompanying neurologic deficits, such as slurred speech, double vision or pathologic nystagmus. - Brain pathology can cause a sensation of disequilibrium which is an off-balance sensation."}]}

Angioedema without uicaria suggests hereditary angioneurotic edema. Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of plasma protein Ci esterase inhibitor. It is an autosomal dominant disorder. It is clinically characterized by:- Episodic edema (nonpitting) in the skin and extremities as well as in the laryngeal and intestinal mucosa provoked by emotional stress or trauma or extreme changes in temperature. Pathophysiology The mediators of edema formation in these patients are proteolytic fragments of complement C2, kinin and bradykinin. - Normally these mediators are kept in check by C1 inhibitor (CIINH) Hereditary angioneurotic edema is caused due to deficiency of the enzyme C1 inhibitor (CIINH). - (CIINH) blocks the first step in the complement pathway i.e. activation of C1. C1 complement is activated by its binding to immune complex. - CIINH prevents this activation. Thus, in the absence of CIINH there is excess of activated C1 which leads to increase in the level of activated C2. - Activated C2 mediates edema formation. Besides being inhibitor of CI,CIINH is also an inhibitor of kinin ReneratinR system. -Kining generating system includes, Hageman.factor and prekallikrein. - Activated hageman factor and prekallikrein leads to the generation of bradykinin which mediates edema formation. Normally the activation of kinin generating system is prevented by (CIINH). - In the absence of (CIINH) there is increased activation of kallikrein and .factor XII which in turn leads to increased .formation of bradykinin which produces edema. Another impoant point about hereditary angioneurotic edema is :? - It presents with angioedema without uicaria. - All patients with angioedema without uicaria should be screened with C4 level which is reduced during and between the attacks of Hereditary angioneurotic edema. One more impoant point Angioneurotic edema can also be precipitated by angiotensin conveing enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, - It occurs due to increased level of bradykinin in the serum. - Bradykinin is degraded by an angiotensin conveing enzyme present in the lung. - ACE inhibitors blocks this enzyme leading to decreased degradation of Bradykinin."}]}

PrP can exist in a variety of different conformations each of which seems to specify a particular disease phenotype.Prion disease: -Prion are fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by transmissible proteins and are characterized by spongiform changes, astrocytic gliomas and neuronal loss from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates in neural cells.Prions are caused by human prion related protein (PrP) {a glycoprotein rich in a helix).PrP is endogenous to the host and in most people, the PrP protein folds normally leaving the person healthy.Rarely, a mutation in the PrP gene will allow the protein to be made incorrectly and it will fold incorrectly making a PrPsc prion. (Which is a glycoprotein rich in b sheets).These PrPsc prions when exposed to PrP, which is in the process of folding will encourage that PrP to fold incorrectly too, thus creating another PrPsc.While PrP can be processed and cleaned out of a cell once it has been used, PrPsc is shaped differently enough so that it can't be cleaned out and it aggregates inside the cell. These PrPsc aggregates quickly builds up into plaques destroying the nervous tissue.Thus a pathological prion protein serves as the templates for the conformational transformation of normal PrP into PrPsc.Remember PrP - made up of a helix?

In CAA, amyloidogenic peptides, usually the same ones found in Alzheimer disease are deposited in the walls of medium and small caliber meningeal and coical vessels. This deposition can weaken the vessel wall and lead to hemorrhage. Many individuals with CAA have evidence of numerous small hemorrhages within the brain 'microbleeds', which can be visualized by various imaging methods. As with Alzheimer disease, in which there is a relationship between a polymorphism in the gene that encodes apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and risk of disease,there is an effect of the ApoE genotype on the risk of recurrence of hemorrhage from sporadic CAA.

Each amino acid have two ionizable group: (r) c-carboxyl group (-COOH), and (ii) c-amino group (-NHr). Beside these two groups, some amino acids have special ionizable groups. e.g. -SH of cysteine, imidazole of histidine. Dissociation constant (pka) is the value of pH at which any ionizable group of amino acid is in 50% ionized form and 50% non-ionized form. Thus, each amino acid has two pka values :- i) pk1 - pH at which 50% of amino acid molecules have a-carboryl group in ionized form (COO-) and 50% molecules have it in unionized form (COOH). ii) pk2 - pH at which 50% of amino acid molecules have a-amino group in ionized form (NH3+) and 50% molecules have it in unionized form (NH2). iii) The value of pk-l and pk-2 is different for different amino acids.

In a tuberculin skin test, T cell proliferation is increased by secretion of interleukins. An extract of tuberculin (an antigen of lipoprotein composition obtained from the tubercle bacillus) is injected into the skin of a person who has had tuberculosis or has been immunized against tuberculosis. Merriory helper T cells react to the tuberculin and secrete Il-2, which up regulates Il-2 receptors. Il-2 binding to Il-2 receptors on the same cell is an example of autocrine regulation in which a cell secretes a ligand for a receptor on its own surface. The result of this up regulation and ligand receptor binding is an increase in T cell proliferation. T cell derived cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and beta (TN Fα and β) induce leukocyte recruitment. Production of gamma-(γ)-interferon by helper T cells attracts and activates macrophages (monocytes comprise most of the cellular infiltrate). γ -Interferon also converts other cells (such asendothelial cells) to antigen-presenting cells by induction of class II MHC expression, which further augments the response.

K+ Genesis of RMPo The cell membrane is selectively permeable. Due to presence of potassium leak channels K+ ions are freely permeable but permeability of Na+ is much less . In the generation of RMP, following sequence of events occur :-i) K+ diffuses out of cell along its concentration gradient (K+ concentration is very high inside the cells and very low in ECF).ii) The diffusion of K+ produces an intracellular negativity (due to non-diffusible protein anion in the cells) which is not nullified by the diffusion of Na+ in the opposite direction (membrane is impermeable to Na+) or diffusion of Cl- in same direction (Cl- concentration is already very high in ECF in comparison to ICF).iii) So, intracellular negativity is produced which opposes outward diffusion of K+ and when the equilibrium is reached, the inward force on K+ due to electrical gradient balances outward force on K+ due to concentation gradient.iv) Finally, at equilibrium inner side of cell is negatively charged with respect to outer side, and resting membrane potential is produced.o So, the RMP is principally due to concentration difference (chemical difference) of K+ in ECF and ICF. In neurons, the resting membrane potential is usually about -70 mV, which is close to the equilibrium potential for K+. Here, it is worth noting that RMP is close to the equilibrium potential of K+ but the value of RMP is exactly same as equilibrium potential of Cl-.

Ans. C: Obliterated colonic gas shadow The most common finding associated with splenic injury is left lower rib fracture. Rib fractures signify that adequate force has been transmitted to cause splenic pathology. The classic triad indicative of acute splenic rupture (ie, left hemidiaphragm elevation, left lower lobe atelectasis, and pleural effusion) is not commonly present and should not be regarded as a reliable sign. However, any patient with apparent left hemidiaphragm elevation following blunt abdominal trauma should be considered to have splenic injury until proven otherwise. More reliable signs of Left Upper Quadrant (LUQ) injury are medial displacement of the gastric bubble and inferior displacement of the splenic flexure gas pattern. These findings are indicative of a LUQ mass and result from either suhcapsular or perisplenic hematoma. LUQ hematoma, if sufficiently large, can displace the shadow of the inferior splenic margin caudally, simulating splenomegaly. Subcapsular hematoma can produce a similar appearance, and the appreciated mass has distinct borders. Associated displacement of the left renal shadow also may be evident. The constitution of findings present when retroperitoneal hemorrhage or free intra-abdominal blood exists contrasts with those mentioned above. Little, if any, mass effect on LUQ organs is apparent. Splenic margins are obscured, but this finding is not specific. Retroperitoneal blood can obliterate the left renal outline and psoas muscle margin. Free blood pools exist dependently in the left paracolic gutter, displacing the descending colon gas pattern medially. Larger amounts of abdominal hemorrhage can obliterate the flank stripe. The small bowel gas pattern can be displaced out of the pelvis by collecting hemorrhage. A midpelvic opacity with sharp convex lateral borders may result.

Hawkins type II fractures have a 20% to 50% risk of avascular necrosis, with the artery of the tarsal canal and the dorsal blood supply from the neck being disrupted. Type III and IV fractures have a 69% to 100% risk of avascular necrosis, with all 3 main sources of blood supply damaged. Greater displacement, comminution, and open fractures could increase the likelihood of developing avascular necrosis. Avascular necrosis of the body weakens the talar trochlea, subjecting it to collapse if full weight bearing is allowed in the presence of avascular necrosis. Whether collapse of the talar dome is partial or full, the subsequent degenerative changes lead to pain and disability in both the ankle and subtalar joints, along with shortening of the affected leg. Malunion and Nonunion Talar neck fractures frequently develop malunion and nonunion, leading to decreased range of motion. The incidence of malunion has been reported to be approximately 30%, and the incidence of nonunion is approximately 2.5%. Typical findings of malunion are varus malalignment of the talar neck and deformity of the medial column. Sangeorzan et al stressed that malalignment of only 2 mm results in significant changes in the subtalar contact characteristics that could lead to the progressive development of posttraumatic arthritis. Posttraumatic Arthritis Long-term follow-up studies have shown high rates of posttraumatic arthritis after talar neck fractures. Causes of posttraumatic arthritis may be multifactorial, and may include damage to articular cartilage at the time of injury, progressive cartilage degeneration from fracture malunion, nonunion causing malalignment and incongruence, or osteonecrosis. The incidence of posttraumatic arthritis after talar neck fractures ranges from 50% to 100%, and is a more common finding than osteonecrosis. The arthritis primarily involves the subtalar joint, but may also affect the ankle and talonavicular joints. The subtalar joint is prone to arthritis because the calcaneus slides past the talus during dislocation, causing compressive and shearing forces that may result in injury to the cartilage.Not all cases of posttraumatic arthritis become symptomatic. The development of severe arthrosis causing chronic pain and stiffness may necessitate arthrodesis if conservative treatment is ineffective."}]}

Temporal bone.CSF otorrhea# The most common cause of CSF otorrhea is trauma with fracture involving the tegmen tympani. Tegmen tympani which is formed in part by the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and the squamous portion of the temporal bone, forms the roof of the middle ear cavity. Other etiologies include perilymphatic fistula, surgeries involving the temporal bone, congenital anomalies, and destructive temporal bone tumors.# Fluid leaking from the nose or external auditory canal must first be positively identified as CSF. Drops of fluid from a CSF leak placed on absorbent filter paper may result in the double-ring sign, a central circle of blood and an outer clear ring of CSF. Serum glucose, chloride, and total protein tests of the fluid are not specific or conclusive for CSF.# Confirm or exclude the presence of CSF in leaking fluid by means of an immunoelectrophoretic study of the fluid for beta-2 transferrin or, beta-trace protein.# Methods for detecting CSF fistulas with intrathecal injections of dye pose a risk of chemical meningitis. Methylene blue, indigo carmine, and phenolsulfonphthalein (PSP) dyes are no longer in use. Some use a dilute solution of fluorescein to localize CSF fistulas both preoperatively and during surgery. Typically, is injected into the lumbar subarachnoid space over more than 1 minute. Cotton pledgets are placed in the nose. The dye reaches the skull base in 6 hours and is present over the cerebral convexities in 24 hours. The pledgets are examined for green fluorescence in a dark room with ultraviolet light 6 hours after the intrathecal PSP injection.# CT myelography is used in the detection of spinal CSF leak. CT cranial cisternography is performed with injection of 5-7 mL of nonionic myelographic contrast medium into the lumbar subarachnoid space. The patient is maintained in the prone position until a CT scan is performed. CT cistemographic findings in CSF leak include the concentration of contrast medium in portions of a paranasal sinus or within ethmoid or mastoid air cells.

Transcription repressors Steroid hormone receptors are intracellular receptors that perform signal transduction for steroid hormones. Steroid hormone receptors are pa of the nuclear receptor family that also includes a group of homologous structured receptors that bind to non-steroid ligands such as thyroid hormones and vitamin A, as well as to vitamin D. All these receptors are transcription factors. They act on nuclear DNA to regulate gene transcription. The steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, retinoic acid form pa of Group I hormones. Group 1 hormones are those which act on intracellular receptors whereas Group II hormones act on receptors located on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane. Group I hormones activate gene transcription by 2 different mechanisms. Steroid hormone receptors are located within cytoplasm, in complex with heat shock protein (HSP). The steroid hormones being lipophilic readily diffuse through the plasma membrane and bind to the steroid receptors. Ligand binding causes dissociation of the heat shock protein from the receptor. The receptor ligand complex then moves into the nucleus and bind with high affinity to a specific DNA sequence called the hormone response element (HRE). This DNA-bound, liganded receptor serves as a high-affinity binding site for one or more transcription activator proteins. This complex then activates gene transcription. In contrast to steroid receptors, receptors for thyroid hormones and retinoids lie within the nucleus already bound to the Hormone response element. However this DNA-bound receptor fails to activate transcription because its complexed with a transcription repressor. This receptor-corepressor complex serves as an active repressor of gene transcription. Binding of thyroid or retionoid hormone results in dissociation of the transcription repressor from the receptor. Receptor activators then bind to the DNA bound liganded receptor complex to activate gene transcription."}]}

Functions of vitamin B12 a. Vitamin B12 contains cobalt in a corrin ring that resembles a porphyrin.(1). Vitamin B12 is the cofactor for methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes the rearrangement of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (see Fig below).(a). This reaction is involved in the production of succinyl-CoA from valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and the propionyl-CoA formed by the oxidation of fatty acids with an odd number of carbons.(2). Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups from FH4 to homocysteine to form methionine (see Figure below).A vitamin B12 deficiency results in a megaloblastic anemia plus demyelination of nerves, because of reduced levels of SAM in the nervous system. These cells are large because the vitamin deficiency interferes with DNA synthesis, and the cells double in size without being able to replicate their DNA. Once the anemia begins, the large blast cells are released by the marrow in an attempt to control the anemia. A hypochromic, microcytic anemia can result from the lack of iron, or lack of pyridoxal phosphate. Both conditions lead to a reduction in the synthesis of heme, so the red cells cannot carry as much oxygen (which gives them the pale color). The cells are small in order to maximize the concentration of hemoglobin present in the cells. Hemolytic anemia occurs when the red cell membrane fragments, which can occur with pyruvate kinase deficiencies or a lack of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity (which results in reduced NADPH levels). Sickle cell anemia is caused by a point mutation in the b-globin gene, substituting a valine for a glutamic acid.The transfer of a 1-carbon unit from serine to deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to form deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP).

Pityriasis rosea is a benign condition that usually presents with a herald patch, a single round or oval lesion appearing anywhere on the body. Usually about 5 to 10 days after the appearance of the herald patch, a more diffuse rash involving the upper extremities and trunk appears. These lesions are oval or round, slightly raised, and pink to brown in color. The lesion is covered in a fine scale with some central clearing possible. The rash can appear in a Christmas tree pattern on the back, identified by the aligning of the long axis of the lesions with the cutaneous cleavage lines. The rash lasts 2 to 12 weeks and can be pruritic. This rash is commonly mistaken for tinea corporis, and the consideration of secondary syphilis is important.Treatment is usually unnecessary but can consist of topical emollients and oral antihistamines, as needed. More uncommonly, topical steroids can be helpful if the itching is severe. Lichen planus is rare in children. It is intensely pruritic, and additional lesions can be induced with scratching. The lesion is commonly found on the flexor surfaces of the wrists, forearms, inner thighs, and occasionally on the oral mucosa. Seborrheic dermatitis can begin anytime during life; it frequently presents as cradle cap in the newborn period. This rash is commonly greasy, scaly, and erythematous and, in smaller children, involves the face, neck, axilla, and diaper area. In older children, the rash can be localized to the scalp and intertriginous areas. Pruritus can be marked. Contact dermatitis is characterized by redness, weeping, and oozing of the affected skin. The pattern of distribution can be helpful in identification of the offending agent. The rash can be pruritic; removal of the causative agent and use of topical emollients or steroids is curative. Psoriasis consists of red papules that coalesce to form plaques with sharp edges. A thick, silvery scale develops on the surface and leaves a drop of blood upon its removal (Auspitz sign). Additional lesions develop upon scratching older lesions. Commonly affected sites include scalp, knees, elbows, umbilicus, and genitalia."}]}

Follicular lymphoma involves the lymph nodes and bone marrow of older people and is characterized by slow, but relentless, growth. Thus, this lymphoma allows a long survival even without any treatment. Indeed, follicular lymphoma is resistant to aggressive therapy because of its low mitotic activity. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a neoplasm of pre-B cells that affects children. Different molecular mechanisms probably account for different cases. Hyperdiploidy, the Philadelphia chromosome, t(12;21), and t(4;11) are variably found in patients with ALL. Burkitt lymphoma occurs in different clinical settings, including the African endemic, sporadic non endemic, and AIDS-associated forms. Histologically, all these forms are identical and are derived from neoplastic transformation of B cells expressing surface IgM. Common to all forms are translocations involving the c-myc oncogene (chromosome 8) and Ig loci (chromosome 14). These translocations lead to overexpression of c-myc, which encodes a nuclear transcription protein, resulting in sustained cell replication. The African form is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Multiple myeloma is a neoplasm of terminally differentiated B lymphocytes that secrete large amounts of monoclonal Ig or its fragments (light or heavy chains).

The symptoms associated with OHSS usually begin 15-20d after hCG is givenOvulation induction promotes follicle maturation and oocyte release utilizing pharmacological agents. The most commonly used agent is Clomiphene citrate, which increases follicle-stimulating hormone release at the level of the hypothalamus. It is usually given for 5d during the mid-follicular phase and ovulation occurs l-10d following the final dose. Alternative ovulation induction agents include metformin and gonadotrophins.Transvaginal US is used to track the development of follicles and the endometrial thickness so that the dose of the agent can be titrated and intercourse or insemination can be correctly timed to coincide with ovulation. Although the maturity of the oocyte can only be indirectly inferred from the size of the follicle, the US information can be coupled with oestradiol values to provide an accurate assessment of the presence or absence and number of mature follicles. It is important to look for the complications of ovulation induction such as hyperstimulation. This occurs most commonly in gonadotrophin-induced cycles. The ovary becomes enlarged, sometimes massively so, and oedematous, containing multiple immature follicles. Abdominal ascites may also be demonstrated. The hyper stimulated ovaries are prone to torsion. The signs and symptoms of ovarian hyperstimulation disorder are variable, ranging from mild abdominal discomfort, probably due to the distension of the ovarian capsule, to severe circulatory compromise and electrolyte imbalance. The more severe form, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), is usually associated with massive stromal oedema of the ovary. The enlarged ovaries may be prone to torsion. On US, patients with OHSS usually have enlarged ovaries (>10cm) that may contain several hypoechoic areas. The hypoechoic areas may correspond to atretic follicles or to regions of hemorrhage within the ovary. The symptoms associated with OHSS usually begin 5-8d after hCG is given, but they can be most severe in patients who actually achieve pregnancy. Recent studies have shown that hyperstimulation is unlikely in women whose ovaries contain several large (>15mm) follicles, and tends to occur when there are several small or intermediate-sized follicles. With supportive therapy, this syndrome usually regresses spontaneously."}]}

Once multiple polyps are detected, patients should undergo a total colectomy, which is the primary therapy to prevent colon cancer. Current guidelines recommend that patients with a family history of FAP should have screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy beginning at the age of 25, followed by annual screening until age 35. An alternative method for identifying carriers is testing peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA for the presence of a mutated APC gene. The detection of this mutation can lead to a definitive diagnosis before the development of polyps. The MEN 1 gene is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, which does not increase the risk of colon cancer. The RET gene is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2. The MSH gene is associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), also known as Lynch syndrome. In contrast to FAP, patients with HNPCC or Lynch syndrome do not develop multiple polyps but instead develop only one or a few adenomas that rapidly progress to cancer. This condition is also strongly associated with ovarian and endometrial carcinoma. The BRCA gene is associated with familial breast and ovarian cancers."}]}

Pancreatic juice is secreted most abundantly in response to the presence of chyme in the upper portions of the small intestine, and the characteristics of the pancreatic juice are determined to some extent by the types of food in the chyme. (The pancreas also secretes insulin, but this is not secreted by the same pancreatic tissue that secretes intestinal pancreatic juice. Instead, insulin is secreted directly into the blood-not into the intestine- by the islets of Langerhans that occur in islet patches throughout the pancreas). The most important of the pancreatic enzymes for digesting proteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypolypeptidase. By far the most abundant of these is trypsin. Trypsin and chymotrypsin split whole and partially digested proteins into peptides of various sizes but do not cause  release  of  individual  amino  acids. However,  carboxypolypeptidase splits some peptides into individual amino acids, thus completing digestion of some proteins all the way to the amino acid state. The pancreatic enzyme for digesting carbohydrates is  pancreatic  amylase, which hydrolyzes starches, glycogen, and most other carbohydrates  (except cellulose) to form mostly disaccharides and a few trisaccharides.The main enzymes for fat digestion are (1) pancreatic lipase, which is capable of hydrolyzing neutral fat into  fatty  acids  and  monoglycerides;  (2) cholesterol esterase, which causes hydrolysis of cholesterol esters;and  (3)  phospholipase,  which splits fatty acids  from phospholipids. When first synthesized in the pancreatic cells, the proteolytic digestive enzymes are in the inactive forms trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxypolypeptidase, which are all inactive enzymatically. They become activated only after they are secreted into the intestinal tract. Trypsinogen is activated by an enzyme called enterokinase, which is secreted by the intestinal mucosa when chyme comes in contact with the mucosa. Also, trypsinogen can be autocatalytically activated by trypsin that has already been formed from previously secreted trypsinogen.  Chymotrypsinogen is  activated by trypsin to form chymotrypsin, and procarboxypolypeptidase is activated in a similar manner."}]}

Absolute contraindications - Nitrous oxide is contraindicated in patients with significant respiratory compromise. The blood: gas paition coefficient of nitrous oxide is 34 times greater than that of nitrogen. This differential solubility means that nitrous oxide can leave the bloodstream and enter air-filled cavities 34 times faster than nitrogen. As a result, nitrous is contraindicated in patients in whom expansion of these air-filled cavities could compromise patient safety. This includes patients with pneumothorax, pulmonary blebs, air embolism, bowel obstruction, and those undergoing surgery of the middle ear and tympanoplasties. - Pneumoperitoneum - Pneumoencephalum - Acute intestinal surgeries and volvulus of gut as it may increase gut distension Relative contraindications - Nitrous oxide is known to interfere with vitamin B12 and folate metabolism. In patients with these preexisting conditions, nitrous oxide should only be used with full precautionary consideration and close monitoring. Paicular precautions should be taken in pediatric patients with underlying vitamin B12 deficiency (genetic or environmental) and conditions related to vitamin B12 deficiency. Nitrous oxide is relatively contraindicated in pregnancy. It is known to have potential teratogenic and fetal toxic effects, paicularly with chronic use. In vitro it depresses myocardium but in vivo this effect is not seen because of stimulation of sympathetic system, so it can be used safely for cardiac patients and for patients in shock."}]}

Autism Prevasive developmental disorder includes the following condition :- Autism - Rett's disorder - Asperger's disorder - Childhood disintegrative disorder - Pervasive disorders not otherwise specified Pervasive development disorders are characterized by three symptom clusters? i) Impairment in social reciprocity marked by poor eye contact, lack of interest in other people and failure to interact appropriately with others. ii) Communicative impairment, it is characterized by either no language at all or by dent speech with errors in tone, prosody, pitch, grammar, or pragmatics. iii) Restricted and repetitive behaviours include using the same words and phrases repeatedly out of context, performing the same action in routine ways or insisting that others do so, or exhibiting other vocal or visual self stimulatory behaviours.Stereotype movements are seen. Stereotype movements are apparently purposeless movements such as hand flapping, head rolling or body rocking.) Now, the salient feature of each pervasive disorder: Autistic disorder It gives all the classical features of pervasive developmental disorder. The patient presents with problems in social interaction, communication and repetitive sterotype behaviour. In most of these patients there is subnormal intelligence. Example A 3 year old boy shows no interest in or connection to his parents, other adults or children. He does not speak voluntarily and is fascinated with watching rotating objects. He screams fiercely when his environment is altered in any way such as when his mother tries to dress him. Rett's disorder It is seen exclusively in females. The characteristic feature of these patients is that they begin to lose their acquired skills. Example After 4 months of normal development, an infant begins to lose her acquired skills. By 18 months of age, she shows little social interaction with her parents, other adults or children and she uses strange hand gestures. Asperger's disorder The impoant point in differential diagnosis of these patients is that they have normal intelligence. These are the only pervasive development disorders in which the intelligence is unimpaired. These patients often have some exceptional ability. They have little or no developmental language delay and relatively normal cognitive development. In the question the lack of social interaction and communication along with stereotypic behaviour (watching her own hard) suggests Autistic disorder. The patient does not give any symptoms of attention deficit disorder i.e. there are no symptoms indicating lack of concentration and hyperactivity. The patients of ADHD can also present with symptoms similar to pervasive developmental disorder but the main complaint will always be that of attention deficit and hyperactivity. Patients with depression should give other features of depression. 200. Ans is (I)) i.e. Serotonin Suicide is caused by diminished serotonin level Serotonin is a hormone that acts as neurotransmitter. Serotonin levels in our body affects a wide range of mental and physical responses and plays a significant role in activities such as temperature regulation, longer sensations, ,sexual behaviour and sleep patterns. Serotonin receptors also help to regulate emotions, cognition, pain and sensory motor function. Serotonin deficiencies can give rise to wide range of illnesses depending on the pa of the brain that is affected. Other neurotransmitters may send the message that we are full but serotonin level determines if we are satisfied. Low serotonin levels in the brain are linked to clinical depression, suicidal tendencies, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive behaviours (such as builimia), schizophrenia sleep problems, migraine, headaches, autism, drug and alcohol addiction, Alzhiemer's diseases and patterns of violent behaviour. \"Diminished central serotonin plays a role in suicidal behaviour. A group at the karolinska institute was the first to note that low concentrations of the serotonin metabolite 5 Hydroxy indoleacetic acid (5HIAA) in the lumbar cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) were associated with suicidal behaviour.\" This finding has been replicated many times and in different diagnostic groups. Postmoem neurochemical studies have repoed modest decrease in serotonin itself or 5HIAA, in either the brain stem or frontal coex of suicide victims. Post moem receptor studies have repoed significant changes in presynaptic and postsynaptic serotonin binding sites in suicide victims."}]}

Glycogen storage disease type II, also called Pompe disease, is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder which damages muscle and nerve cells throughout the body. It is caused by an accumulation of glycogen in the lysosome due to deficiency of the lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase enzyme. It is the only glycogen storage disease with a defect in lysosomal metabolism, and the first glycogen storage disease to be identified,The disease is caused by a mutation in a gene (acid alpha-glucosidase: also known as acid maltase) on long arm of chromosome 17.Most cases appear to be due to three mutations. A transversion (T - G) mutation is the most common among adults with this disorder. This mutation interrupts a site of RNA splicing.The gene encodes a protein--acid alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20)--which is a lysosomal hydrolase. The protein is an enzyme that normally degrades the alpha -1,4 and alpha -1,6 linkages in glycogen, maltose and isomaltose and is required for the degradation of 1-3% of cellular glycogen. The deficiency of this enzyme results in the accumulation of structurally normal glycogen in lysosomes and cytoplasm in affected individuals.clinical features: Accumulation of glycogen in lysosomes: Juvenile onset variant, muscle hypotonia, death from hea failure by age 2; adult onset variant, muscle dystrophy"}]}

Ans. A. Superior constrictorThe tonsillar bed-a. The lateral or deep surface of the tonsil spreads downwards, upwards and forwards.b. Inferiorly, it invades the dorsum of the tongue, superiorly, the soft palate, and, anteriorly, it may extend for some distance under the palatoglossal arch.c. This deep, lateral aspect is covered by a layer of fibrous tissue, the tonsillar hemi capsule.d. The latter is separable with ease for most of its extent from the underlying muscular wall of the pharynx, which is formed here by the superior constrictor, and sometimes by the anterior fibres of palatopharyngeus, with styloglossus on its lateral side.e. Antero inferiorly, the hemi capsule adheres to the side of the tongue and to palatoglossus and palatopharyngeus. In this region, the tonsillar artery, a branch of the facial artery, pierces the superior constrictor to enter the tonsil, accompanied by venae comitantes.f. An important and sometimes large vein, the external palatine or para tonsillar vein, descends from the soft palate lateral to the tonsillar hemi capsule before piercing the pharyngeal wall. Haemorrhage from this vessel from the upper angle of the tonsillar fossa may complicate tonsillectomy.g. The muscular wall of the tonsillar fossa separates the tonsil from the ascending palatine artery, and, occasionally, from the tortuous facial artery itself, which may lie near the pharyngeal wall at the lower tonsillar level.h. The glossopharyngeal nerve lies immediately lateral to the muscular wall of the tonsillar fossa: it is at risk if the wall is pierced, and is commonly temporarily affected by oedema following tonsillectomy.i.

MACROLIDE ANTIBIOTICS These are antibiotics having a macrocyclic lactone ring with attached sugars.

Interestingly, the nonantibiotic macrolides: tacrolimus, pimecrolimus and sirolimus also possess immunomodulatory properties. The antibiotic effects of macrolides are mediated by inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis, through inhibition of peptidyltransferase activity. They have been frequently used in the past for treating many upper respiratory tract infections including GAS pharyngitis with adequate efficacy (>90%). Their effects on immunomodulation appear to extend beyond their antimicrobial actions as they have been shown to mitigate cytokine production in animal studies and human trials. While its antibiotic properties have been attributed to mechanisms shared by other macrolides, AZM has been shown to act primarily on the lymphokine CD4 Th1 cell line reducing the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-6, and increasing the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 in macrophage cell lines after stimulation with a combination of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IFN-γ. The immunomodulatory potential of AZM is not limited to suppression of production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, it also suppresses iNOS-mediated nitric oxide production. These agents also work at a molecular level, decreasing mRNA expression thereby promoting apoptosis of inflammatory cells and a decrease in nuclear transcription factors."}]}

Fibres. though Harrison writes that dietary fibres play no role in colon cancer, all other books i.e. Schwartz, CSDT & Maingot's are of the view that a high fibre diet has protective effect and a low fibre diet increases the risk..  Alcohol - is also a risk factor Ingestion of calcium, selenium, vitamin A, C & E, carotenoids, and plant phenols decrease the risk of colon cancer.

This patient has a reducible inguinal hernia. A hernia is a protrusion of a structure, usually intestine, through tissue that normally contains it. Inguinal hernias are either direct or indirect. Indirect inguinal hernias occur through the internal inguinal ring in a protrusion of peritoneum along the spermatic cord in the internal spermatic fascia. Direct inguinal hernias occur through the floor of the inguinal canal, separate from the spermatic cord as a result of breakdown of the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and transversalis fascia. If the mass, i.e., hernia, is easily returned back to its normal position, then it is called reducible. If the mass is not reducible, then this is called incarcerated. And, if the mass becomes incarcerated and develops compromised blood supply, it is termed strangulated. Strangulated hernias require emergent repair because the intestinal contents will necrose and cause the patient to become sick. As long as the mass is reducible, surgical repair can be performed on an outpatient basis. A hydrocele is a fluid collection contained within the tunica vaginalis that surrounds the testicle. It presents as a painless swelling of the scrotum, which transilluminates light when it is placed against the mass. A hydrocele cannot be reduced. Femoral hernias are more common in women, presenting as swellings in the upper pa of the thigh. The neck of the hernia sac lies at the femoral ring, below and lateral to the pubic tubercle, distinguishing these from inguinal hernias, which are above and medial to the tubercle. A mass caused by testicular cancer cannot be reduced either. Patients will complain of a dull, heavy, aching feeling within the testicle. The testicle itself is usually enlarged, hard, irregular, and non tender."}]}

Spermatozoa leaving the testes are not fully mobile. They continue their maturation and acquire motility during their passage through the epididymis. Motility is obviously important in vivo, but fertilization occurs in vitro if an immotile spermatozoon from the head of the epididymis is microinjected directly into an ovum. The ability to move forward (progressive motility), which is acquired in the epididymis, involves activation of a unique protein called CatSper, which is localized to the principal piece of the sperm tail.b. This protein appears to be a Ca2+ ion channel that permits cAMP-generalized Ca2+ influx. In addition, spermatozoa express olfactory receptors, and ovaries produce odorant-like molecules. Recent evidence indicates that these molecules and their receptors interact, fostering movement of the spermatozoa toward the ovary (chemotaxis).c. Ejaculation of the spermatozoon involves contractions of the vas deferens mediated in part by P2X receptors, ligand gated cation channels that respond to ATP (see Chapter 7), and fertility is reduced in mice in which these receptors are knocked out.d. Once ejaculated into the female, the spermatozoa move up the uterus to the isthmus of the uterine tubes, where they slow down and undergo capacitation. This further maturation process involves two components: increasing the motility of the spermatozoa and facilitating their preparation for the acrosome reaction. However, the role of capacitation appears to be facilitatory rather than obligatory, because fertilization is readily produced in vitro. From the isthmuses the capacitated spermatozoa move rapidly to the tubal ampullas, where fertilization takes place."}]}

It is essential to destroy endometrial functionalis and basalis as well as 3mm of myometrial depth. Procedure : After appropriate inspection of the landmarks and endometrial cavity, a wire loop electrode is used to resect several strips of endomyometrium, to a depth of 4mm.

Transmission cannot occur until the parasite population has increased many fold and been disseminated, e.g. to the salivary glands. Cyclopropagative transmission In this case, protozoan parasites undergo both development and reproduction within the vector.

Thus Technetium-labelled hydroxy methylene diphosphonate ( 99mTc-HDP) is injected intravenously and its activity recorded by a gamma camera at two stages - 1. shortly after injection, while it is still in the bloodstream or the perivascular space (the perfusion or blood pool phase) 2. 3 hours later when the isotope has been taken up in bone (the bone phase) 4 types of abnormality are seen - a. Increased activity in the perfusion phase this is due to increased soft tissue blood ow - one of the cardinal features of inflammation (eg. acute or chronic synovitis) b. Decreased activity in the perfusion phase This is much less common and signifies local vascular insufficiency c. Increased activity in the bone phase This is due to either excessive isotope uptake in the osseous extracellular uid or to more avid incorporation into newly forming bone tissue. There are several possible reasons for bone activity - cancer is one of them, but other reasons include arthritis, fractures and bone infections and nothing in the bone scan itself can distinguish between them. d. Diminished activity in the bone phase This is due to absent blood supply eg. in the femoral head after a fracture of the femoral neck or to a replacement of bone by pathological tissue.

When a bacteria becomes lysogenized, occasionally, extra genes carried by the phage gets expressed in the bacteria. This gene can change the properties of the bacteria. This process is known as lysogenic conversion or phage conversion. Example: Lysogenic conversion in corynebacterium diphtheria converts it into pathogenic bacteria. After lysogenic conversion, C. diphtheria acquires the ability to produce toxin. Bacteriophage • Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. • Bacteriophages resemble most viruses in having a protein coat called a capsid that surrounds a molecule of DNA or RNA. • Typical phages have hollow heads (where DA or RNA is stored) and tunnel tails. The tail possesses many fibres. The fibres ha%re the ability to bind to specific molecules on the bacterial cell surface. • When a phage binds to bacterial cell surface it is called adsorption. The phage then undergoes penetration, in which the viral DNA is injected through the tail into the host. Types of phages: Lytic or virulent phages and Temperate or prophages 1. Lytic or virulent phages: Lytic phages multiply inside the cell and release a burst of phages through the membrane, lysing the cell. 2. Prophages or temperate phages: Prophages or temperate phages, on the other hand, do not immediately lyse the bacteria they infect. Instead, they integrate their DNA into host DNA creating a phage. The phage DNA in this repressed state is called a prophage (because it is not a phage but it has the potential to produce phage) The integrated state of phage DNA is termed prophage, whereas, the process is known as lysogeny and the bacteria harbouring the prophage are called lysogenic bacteria. Since the prophage contains genes, it can. confer new properties to the bacteria. When a bacteria becomes lysogenized, occasionally, extra genes carried by the phage gets expressed in the bacteria. This gene can change the properties of the bacteria. This process is known as lysogenic conversion or phage conversion. Lysogenic conversion in Corynebacterium Diphtheria converts it into pathogenic bacteria. After lysogenic conversion, C. diphtheria acquires the ability' to produce toxin. Lysogenic conversion is also seen in Salmonella typhi and Clostridium botulinum. Transduction Transduction occurs when bacteriophage carries a piece of bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another. • Transduction is not only confined to transfer of chromosomal DNA, episomes and plasmid may also be transduced. • The plasmid is a DNA molecule that is separate from and can replicate independently of chromosomal. • Types of transduction. • Lytic phages cause generalized transduction. • Temperate phages cause specialized transduction"}]}

Sickle cell anemia is caused by replacement of normal Hemoglobin by sickled hemoglobin (HbS). HbS is formed by replacement of Glutamine by Valine at position 6 This substitution replaces the polar Glutamine residue with a nonpolar Valine. The replacement of Glutamine by Valine generates a sticky patch on the surface of HBS. The sticky patch is present on both oxygenated and deoxygenated HbS The deoxygenated HbS also contains a complementary site for the sticky patch. In oxygenated hemoglobin this complementary site is masked. When HbS is deoxygenated the sticky patch present on its surface binds to the complementary patch on another deoxygenated HbS molecules. This binding leads to polymerization of deoxyhemoglobin S forming long fibrous precipitates. These extend throughout the erythrocyte and mechanically distort it, causing lysis and multiple secondary clinical effect.. So, if HbS can be maintained in an oxygenated state or if the concentration of deoxygenated HbS can be minimized, formation of these polymers will not occur and sickling can be prevented (Remember the complementary site for the sticky patch remains masked in case of Oxygenated HbS). Role of HbA in polymerization —. Unlike HbS, A does not contain any sticky patch, but it does have a binding site for the sticky patch of 1,,S. Thus it can bind to HbS through its receptor site but this binding cannot extend the polymer because HbA does not contain any sticky patch to promote binding to still another hemoglobin molecule. So HbA interferes with the polymerization and aggregation of  HbS and reduces the intensity of sickle cell anemia."}]}

Ans. D: Decreases following gastrectomyIn adults, the amount of iron lost from the body is relatively small. The losses are generally unregulated, and total body stores of iron are regulated by changes in the rate at which it is absorbed from the intestine.Various dietary factors affect the availability of iron for absorption; for example, the phytic acid found in cereals reacts with iron to form insoluble compounds in the intestine. So do phosphates and oxalates.Most of the iron in the diet is in the ferric (Fe3+) form, whereas it is the ferrous (Fe2+) form that is absorbed. Fe3+ reductase activity is associated with the iron transpoer in the brush borders of the enterocytesNo more than a trace of iron is absorbed in the stomach, but the gastric secretions dissolve the iron and permit it to form soluble complexes with ascorbic acid and other substances that aid its reduction to the Fe2+ form. The impoance of this function in humans is indicated by the fact that iron deficiency anemia is a troublesome and relatively frequent complication of paial gastrectomy.Almost all iron absorption occurs in the duodenum. Some is stored in ferritin, and the remainder is transpoed out of the enterocytes by a basolateral transpoer named ferropoin 1. A protein called hephaestin (Hp) is associated with ferropoin 1. It is not a transpoer itself, but it facilitates basolateral transpo.In the plasma, Fe2+ is conveed to Fe3+and bound to the iron transpo protein transferrin. This protein has two iron-binding sites. Normally, transferrin is about 35% saturated with iron.Intestinal absorption of iron is regulated by three factors: recent dietary intake of iron, the state of the iron stores in the body, and the state of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow."}]}

Acanthamoebic keratitis is frequently associated with the wearing of soft contact lenses. Acanthamoeba keratitis It is a rare disease in which amoebae invade the cornea of the eye In developed countries, it is nearly always associated with contact lens use, as Acanthamoeba can survive in the space between the lens and the eye. For this reason, contact lenses must be properly disinfected before wearing, and should be removed when swimming or surfing. However, elsewhere in the world, many cases of Acanthamoeba present in non-contact lens wearers To detect Acanthamoeba on a contact lens in a laboratory, a sheep blood agar plate with a layer (a lawn) of E. coli is made. Pa of the contact lens is placed on the agar plate. If Acanthamoeba are present, they will ingest the bacteria, leaving a clear patch on the plate around the area of the lens.

For example in cardiac amyloidosis, the definitive diagnosis of the type of amyloid can be made using an endomyocardial biopsy specimen with Congo red and immunologic staining of the tissue sample. Alternatively, when a noninvasive testing suggests cardiac amyloidosis - A specific diagnosis is often made by studying a subcutaneous fat aspiration instead of endomyocardial biopsy thereby avoiding an invasive procedure. When the subcutaneous fat aspiration biopsy does not provide information to reach a firm diagnosis, biopsy samples can be collected from other organs. In addition, an advantage to performing a biopsy of an involved organ (e.g., kidney heart) is that it definitively establishes a cause and effect relationship between the organ dysfunction and amyloid. It is important to realize that not all biopsy sites offer the same sensitivity.. The best sites of biopsy are: -. Abdominal fat pad and (90% sensitivity) Rectal mucosa (73% - 84% sensitivity). Other sites that are often sampled but have poor sensitivity for the diagnosis of amyloid include: -. Salivary glands Skin Tongue Gingiva Stomach Bone marrow"}]}

Ans. A: Sand fly Kala-azar is spread through an insect vector, the sandfly of the Phlebotomus genus. The sandfly vector becomes infected when feeding on the blood of an infected individual or an animal reservoir host. The leishmania parasites live in the macrophages as round, non-motile amastigotes (3-7 micrometers in diameter). The macrophages are ingested by the fly during the blood- meal and the amastigotes are relesed into the stomach of insect. Almost immediately the amastigotes transform in to the motile, elongated (10-20 micrometers), flagellate promastigote form. The promastigotes then migrate to the alimentary tract of the fly, where they live extracellularly and multiply by binary fission. Four to five days after feeding the promastigotes move forward to the oesophagus and the salivary glands of the insect. When the sandlfy next feeds on a mammalian host, it's proboscis pierces the skin and saliva containing anticoagulant is injected into the wound to prevent the blood from clotting, the leishmania promastigotes are transferred to the host along with the saliva. Once in the host the promastigotes are taken up by the macrophages where they rapidly reve to the amastigote form. The leishmania are able to resist the microbiocidal action of the acid hydrolases release form the lysozymes and so survive and multiply inside the macrophages, eventually leading to the lysis of the macrophages. The released amastigotes are taken up by additional macrophages and so the cycle continues. Ultimately all the organs containing macrophages and phagocytes are infected, especially the spleen, liver and bone marrow."}]}

Release of acetylcholine o The process by which excitation (depolarization) of muscle fiber initiates its contraction is known as excitation contraction coupling.o The skeletal muscle fiber is innervated by A-a motor neuron.o When A-a motor neuron is stimulated, it carries the impulse (action potential) to neuromuscular junction where release of acetylcholineQ from presynaptic vesicle occurs. Acetylcholine binds to specific receptors (NmnicotinicQ) on motor-end plate (post-synaptic membrane).o This results in production of end-plate potential. If end-plate potential depolarizes the motor-end plate to firing (threshold) level, action potential is produced.o Once the Ca2+ concentration outside the reticulum has been lowered sufficiently, chemical interaction between myosin and actin ceases and the muscle relaxes,o This is due to reuptake of Ca2+ by sarcoplasmic reticulum,o Thus during relaxation :- Cytoplasmic concentration of Ca^ decreases.Sarcoplasmic reticulum concentration of Ca\"2 increases.About option 'a'o Ca2+(ion) does not move out of cytoplasm (i.e. extracellular).

As a result, the binding sites (active sites) on the actin filament are exposed.o ATP binds to myosin and myosin splits this ATP into ADP due to its ATPase activity. The energy released activates the myosin and the activated myosin head binds to active sites of actin filament, i.e.. Cross-bridging of myosin with actin. This cross-bridging immediately produces bending (flexion) of myosin head from 90deg to 45deg. Bending of myosin head produces \"power stroke' that causes sliding of actin on myosin and muscle contraction,o As the myosin head flexes to 45,:' (during power stroke), the ADP present on it is cast off making way for a fresh molecule of ATP.

Factors That Impair Tissue Repair  Tissue repair may be impaired by a variety of factors that reduce the quality or adequacy of the reparative process. Factors that interfere with healing may be extrinsic (e.g., infection) or intrinsic to the injured tissue, and systemic or local:. Infection is one of the most important causes of delayed healing; it prolongs inflammation and potentially increases the local tissue injury. Diabetes is a metabolic disease that compromises tissue repair for many reasons, and is an important systemic cause of abnormal wound healing. Nutritional status has profound effects on repair; protein malnutrition and vitamin C deficiency, for example, inhibit collagen synthesis and retard healing. Glucocorticoids (steroids) have well-documented anti-inflammatory effects, and their administration may result in weak scars because they inhibit TGF-β production and diminish fibrosis. In some instances, however, the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are desirable. For example, in corneal infections, glucocorticoids may be prescribed (along with antibiotics) to reduce the likelihood of opacity due to collagen deposition. Mechanical factors such as increased local pressure or torsion may cause wounds to pull apart (dehisce). Poor perfusion, resulting either from arteriosclerosis and diabetes or from obstructed venous drainage (e.g., in varicose veins), also impairs healing. Foreign bodies such as fragments of steel, glass, or even bone impede healing. The type and extent of tissue injury affects subsequent repair. Complete restoration can occur only in tissues composed of cells capable of proliferating: even then, an extensive injury will probably result in incomplete tissue regeneration and at least partial loss of function. Injury to tissues composed of non-dividing cells must inevitably result in scarring; such is the case with healing of a myocardial infarct. The location of the injury and the character of the tissue in which the injury occurs also are important..     Robins 10 th ed page no 93"}]}

Some texts list four layers by counting the two sublayers of the mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria) separately. The lamina propria is rich in blood vessels and lymphatic channels. The muscular layer is composed of smooth muscle fibers, with an outer layer of longitudinal muscle, an inner layer of circular muscle, and oblique muscle fibers between. The outer layer, the adventitia, is a thin dense layer of connective tissue, and it blends with loose connective tissue containing blood vessels, lymphatic vessels and nerve fibers that is present between the pelvic organs.The epithelial covering of the cervix is continuous with the epithelial lining of the vagina. The vaginal mucosa is absent of glands. The vaginal epithelium consists of three rather arbitrary layers of cells - superficial flat cells, intermediate cells and basal cells - and estrogen induces the intermediate and superficial cells to fill with glycogen. The superficial cells exfoliate continuously and basal cells replace them Under the influence of maternal estrogen, newborn females have a thick stratified squamous epithelium for two to four weeks after bih. After that, the epithelium remains thin with only a few layers of cells without glycogen until pubey, when the epithelium thickens and glycogen containing cells are formed again, under the influence of the girl's rising estrogen levels. Finally, the epithelium thins out during menopause onward and eventually ceases to contain glycogen, because of the lack of estrogen In abnormal circumstances, such as in pelvic organ prolapse, the vaginal epithelium may be exposed becoming dry and keratinized"}]}

Angiogenesis. Tumour angiogenesis plays a very significant role in the metastasis since the new vessel formed as a part of growing tumour are more vulnerable to invasion because these evolving cells are in direct contact with cancer cells.According to Harrison, cancer research studying the conditions necessary for cancer metastasis have discovered that one of the critical events required is the, growth of a new network of blood vessels called tumour angiogenesis. Angiogenesis in tumours refers to tumour stimulates the growth of host blood vessels which is essential for supplying nutrients to the tumour. Tumours cannot enlarge beyond 1-2 mm in diameter or thickness unless they are vascularized because the 1- 2 mm zone represents the maximal distance across which oxygen and nutrients can diffuse from blood vessels. Angiogenesis of tumour imparts two benefits - Growth of tumour by supplying oxygen and nutrient to tumour cells. - Endothelial cells of new blood vessels secrete growth factors which stimulate the growth of adjacent tumour cells. Distant metastasis Without access to the vasculature, the tumour cells cannot rapidly spread to distant sites. Tumour associated angiogenic factors. Tumours secrete certain factors which induce neovascularization. Two most important are - Vascular endothelial derived growth factor (VEGF) - Basic fibroblast growth factor (BFGF). Steps in the spread of cancer -Aggressive clonal proliferation and angiogenesis. The first step in the spread of cancer cells is the development of rapidly proliferating clone of cancer cells. Detachment of tumour cellsNormal cells remain glued to each other due to presence of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) i.e. E cadherin.Normal function of E cadherin is dependent on catenins that helps in linkage of cytoskeleton to E cadherin.Down regulation of expression of either E cadherins or catenins results in loosening of cells that helps in metastasis.Tumour cell and extracellular matrix interactionLoosened cancer cells attach to ECM proteins mainly Laminin and fibronectin through a special protein integrin.Degradation of ECMTumour cells overexpress proteases and matrix degrading enzymes i.e., metalloproteinases that includes collagenase and gelatinase.Another protease cathepsin D is also increased in certain cancers.These enzymes bring about dissolution of extracellular matrix - Firstly basement membrane of tumour itself is dissolved then it make way for the tumour cells through the interstitial matrix and finally the basement membrane of the vessel wall is dissolved.Entry of tumour cells into capillary lumen:-Tumour cells after degrading the basement membrane are ready to migrate into lumen of capillaries or venules for which the following mechanisms play a role.Autocrine motility factor (AMF) is a cytokine derived from tumour cells and stimulate receptor mediated motility of tumour cells.Cleavage product of matrix components. Which are formed following degradation of ECM have properties of tumour cell chemotaxis, growth promotion and angiogenesis in cancer.After the malignant cells have migrated through the breached basement membrane, these cells enter the lumen of lymphatic and capillary channels.Thrombus formation The tumour cells protruding in the lumen of the capillary are now covered with constituents of the circulating blood and form the thrombus.Thrombus provides nourishment to the tumour cells and also prevent them from immune attack. Extravasation of tumour cellsTumour cells in the circulation may mechanically block these vascular channels and attach to vascular end. In this way, the sequence similar to local invasion is repeated and the basement membrane is exposed."}]}

Bisphosphonates are analogs of pyrophosphate. They have a common structure, P-C-P, similar to the structure of the native pyrophosphate P-O-P found in bone hydroxyapatite. Mechanism of Action The bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by binding to the hydroxyapatite crystals of bone. (The bisphosphonates have a strong affinity for bone, targeting especially bone surfaces undergoing remodeling) When osteoclasts first attach to bone in the active resorptive sites, the bisphosphonates are released from that hone. The release of these compounds locally prevents fuher osteoclastic attachment to those resorptive surfaces. The bisphosphonates also may inhibit resorption by inducing apoptosis of osteoclasts and by inhibiting release of interleukins and other compounds involved in bone resorption. The net result of action of these compounds is inhibition of bone osteoclastic resorption. Uses They are used extensively in conditions characterized by osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. including - Osteoporosis (postmenopausal osteoporosis, idiopathic and steroid induced osteoporosis) - Paget's disease, - Osteolytic bone metastasis, and - Hypercalcemia of malignancy Recent evidence suggests that second- and third-generation bisphosphonates also may be effective anticancer drugs.

Ans. C: Sliding herniaIndirect inguinal herniaAn indirect inguinal hernia follows the tract through the inguinal canal. This results from a persistent process vaginalis. The inguinal canal begins in the intra-abdominal cavity at the internal inguinal ring, located approximately midway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior iliac spine.The canal courses down along the inguinal ligament to the external ring, located medial to the inferior epigastric arteries, subcutaneously and slightly above the pubic tubercle.Contents of this hernia then follow the tract of the testicle down into the scrotal sac.Direct herniaA direct inguinal hernia usually occurs due to a defect or weakness in the transversalis fascia area of the Hesselbach triangle.The triangle is defined inferiorly by the inguinal ligament, laterally by the inferior epigastric arteries, and medially by the conjoined tendon.Femoral herniaThe femoral hernia follows the tract below the inguinal ligament through the femoral canal. The canal lies medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar (Gimbernat) ligament.Because femoral hernias protrude through such a small defined space, they frequently become incarcerated or strangulated.Umbilical herniaThe umbilical hernia occurs through the umbilical fibromuscular ring, which usually obliterates by 2 years of age. They are congenital in origin and are repaired if they persist in children older than age 2-4 years.Richter herniaThe Richter hernia occurs when only the antimesenteric border of the bowel herniates through the fascial defect. The Richter hernia involves only a poion of the circumference of the bowel.As such, the bowel may not be obstructed, even if the hernia is incarcerated or strangulated, and the patient may not present with vomiting.The Richter hernia can occur with any of the various abdominal hernias and is paicularly dangerous, as a poion of strangulated bowel may be reduced unknowingly into the abdominal cavity, leading to perforation and peritonitis Incisional herniaThis iatrogenic hernia occurs in 2-10% of all abdominal operations secondary to breakdown of the fascial closure of prior surgery. Even after repair, recurrence rates approach 20-45%.Spigelian herniaThis rare form of abdominal wall hernia occurs through a defect in the spigelian fascia, which is defined by the lateral edge of the rectus muscle at the arcuate line (costal arch to the pubic tubercle).Obturator herniaThis hernia passes through the obturator foramen, following the path of the obturator nerves and muscles. Obturator hernias occur with a female-to-male ratio of 6:1, because of a gender-specific larger canal diameter.Because of its anatomic position, this hernia presents more commonly as a bowel obstruction than as a protrusion of bowel contentsSliding herniaAs a result of slipping of the posterior parietal peritoneum on the underlying retroperitoneal structures, the posterior wall of the sac is not formed of peritoneum alone, but by the sigmoid colon and its mesentery on the left, the caecum on the right and, sometimes on either side by a poion of the bladder."}]}

Recurrent hypoglycemic attack with hepatomegaly is seen in Type I glycogen storage disease (Von Gierke disease). Glycogen storage diseases . Glycogen storage diseases result from a hereditary deficiency of one of the enzymes involved in the synthesis or sequential degradation of glycogen. Clinical features depend on the type of enzyme deficiency and organ involvement. Glycogen storage diseases can be divided into:-. 1) Hepatic form (Liver glycogenolysis). The liver is the key player in glycogen metabolism. It contains enzymes that synthesize glycogen for storage and ultimately break it down into free glucose, which is then released into the blood. So, An inherited deficiency of hepatic enzymes that are involved in glycogen metabolism leads to. i)  Storage of glycogen in liver → Hepatomegaly. ii) Reduction in blood glucose → Hypoglycemia.. Examples of liver glycogenoses are -.  Type I glycogenosis → Glucose - 6 - phosphatase deficiency (Von Gierke disease). Type III glycogenosis → Debranching enzyme def Type IV glycogenesis → Branching enzyme def Type VI glycogenosis → Liver phosphorylase def. 2) Myopathic form (Muscular glycogenoses). In skeletal muscle, as opposed to the liver, glycogen is used predominantly as a source of energy..  This is derived from glycolysis, which leads ultimately to the formation of lactate. So, enzyme deficiency leads to -.  Glycogen deposition in muscle Muscle cramp after exercise The exercise-induced rise in blood lactate levels owing to block in glycolysis There may be myoglobinuria.  Examples are -.  Type V glycogenosis → phosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease). Type VII glycogenosis → phosphofructokinase def. 3) Miscellaneous types. Associated with glycogen storage in many organs and death in early life. Examples -. i)    Type II glycogenosis → Acid maltase deficiency (Pompe's disease)"}]}

Orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are RNA viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome. The influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviruses. They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0.5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated.

Dermatitis herpetiformis can accompany the celiac disease. The IgA or IgG antibodies formed against the gliadin protein in gluten that is ingested (commonly in wheat, rye, and barley grains) cross-react with reticulin. Reticulin is a component of the anchoring fibrils that attach the epidermal basement membrane to the superficial dermis. This explains the localization of the IgA to the tips of dermal papillae and the site of inflammation. A gluten-free diet may relieve the symptoms. Bullous pemphigoid can occur in older individuals, with an antibody directed at keratinocytes to produce flaccid bullae, but there is no association with celiac disease. Contact dermatitis is most likely to be seen on the hands and forearms. It is a type IV hypersensitivity reaction without immunoglobulin deposition and would not persist for 1 month. Discoid lupus erythematosus is seen in sun-exposed areas and has the appearance of an erythematous rash.

This is piriformis syndrome. As you may recall from your anatomy, the piriformis is the small muscle that crosses the greater sciatic foramen, cutting it into two spaces as the muscle passes from the edge of the sacrum to the greater trochanter. The sciatic nerve comes out of the greater sciatic foramen below the piriformis, and is liable to compression by the muscle. Symptoms are as described above; bicycle riding and running may also set off the symptoms, which may take the form of chronic nagging ache, pain, tingling, or numbness. Treatment is usually to teach the patient to avoid maneuvers that set off the symptoms. Some patients have been helped by corticosteroid injection near the site where the piriformis muscle crosses the sciatic nerve; this therapy is thought to work by reducing the fat around the muscle and thereby increasing the available space in the area. Disk compression of the sciatic nerve can also produce sciatic pain, but there is almost always lumbar as well as buttock pain. Fibromyalgia causes achy pain, tenderness, and stiffness of involved sites, including muscles, tendon insertions, and nearby soft tissues.

With the addition of an incision on the left side of the neck, the surgeon completes the mobilization of the esophagus, removes it, and moves the stomach upward through the hiatus and into the chest until its upper end appears in the neck wound. The remaining esophagus is connected to the stomach in the neck (cervical esophagogastric anastomosis)..  Advantages of Transhiatal esophagectomy over transthoracic esophagectomy: The two leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the first few days after a transthoracic esophagectomy are. Lung complications (especially pneumonia) associated with a large operation that requires opening both the chest and the abdomen.

More negativeDuring quiet breathing, the intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3 and -6 mm Hg, depending upon the phase of respiration, more negative at the end of inspiration and less negative during expiration.Intrapleural pressure (Pleural pressure)It is the pressure between two pleural surfaces. The lung is covered with visceral pleura and the thoracic cage is lined on inside with parietal pleura. Between the two layers of pleura is a very narrow space, called the pleural cavity. Intrapleural pressure is always negative and during quiet breathing the Intrapleural pressure fluctuates between -3.8 mm Hg (- 5.0 cm watery to -6.0 mm Hg (-8.0 cm water).Now let us examine why the pleural pressure is negative; more negative during inspiration, less negative during expiraion, but always negative during quiet breathing. The key to the answer is the fact that both the thoracic cage and lungs are elastic structures. Being elastic structure they both tend to recoil, but in opposite direction. The lungs have a tendency to collapse and thoracic cage has a tendency to expand. However, because of the anatomical relationships in the body, these tendencies do not normally materialize. But the tendencies do create an inward pull on the visceral pleura (by lung) and an outward pull on parietal pleura (by thoracic cage). The results of these pulls is a negative pressure in the space between the pleural surfaces, i.e., in the pleural cavity."}]}

The process involved in the development of a mature ovum is called oogenesis. The primitive germ cells take their origin from the yolk sac at about the end of 3rd week and their migration to the developing gonadal ridge is completed round about the end of 4th week. In the female gonads, the germ cells undergo a number of rapid mitotic divisions and differentiate into oogonia. The number of oogonia reaches its maximum at 20th week, numbering about 7 million. While the majority of the oogonia continue to divide, some enter into the prophase of the first meiotic division and are called primary oocytes. These are surrounded by flat cells and are called primordial follicles and are present in the coex of the ovary. At bih, there is no more mitotic division and all the oogonia are replaced by primary oocytes which have finished the prophase of the first meiotic division and remain in resting phase (dictyotene stage) between prophase and metaphase. Total number of primary oocytes at bih is estimated to be about 2 million. The primary oocytes do not finish the first meiotic division until pubey is reached. At pubey, some 400,000 primary oocytes are left behind, the rest being atretic. Out of these, some 400 are likely to ovulate during the entire reproductive period."}]}

Phosphate Types of renal calculusOxalate calculus (calcium oxalate)* Oxalate stones are irregular in shape and covered with sharp projections, which tend to cause bleeding. The surface of the calculus is discoloured by altered blood. A calcium oxalate monohydrate stone is hard and radiodense.Phosphate calculus* A phosphate calculus is smooth and dirty white. It tends to grow in alkaline urine, especially when urea-splitting Proteus organisms are present. As a result, the calculus may enlarge to fill most of the collecting system, forming a staghorn calculus. Even a very large staghorn calculus may be clinically silent for years until it signals its presence by haematuria, urinary infection or renal failure. Because they are large, phosphate calculi are usually easy to see on radiographic films.Uric acid and urate calculi* These are hard, smooth and often multiple. They vary from yellow to reddish brown and sometimes have an attractive, multi- faceted appearance. Pure uric acid stones are radiolucent and appear on an excretion urogram as a filling defect, which can be mistaken for a transitional tumour of the upper urinary tract. The presence of uric acid stones is confirmed by CT. Most uric acid stones contain some calcium, so they cast a faint radiological shadow. In children, mixed stones of ammonium and sodium urate are sometimes found. They are yellow, soft and friable. They are radiolucent unless they are contaminated with calcium salts.Cystine calculus* These uncommon stones appear in the urinary tract of patients with a congenital error of metabolism that leads to cystinuria. Hexagonal, translucent, white crystals of cystine appear only in acid urine. They are often multiple and may grow to form a cast of the collecting system. Pink or yellow when first removed, they change to a greenish colour when exposed to air. Cystine stones are radioopaque because they contain sulphur, and they are very hard.Xanthine calculus* These are extremely rare. They are smooth and round, brick-red in colour, and show lamellation on cross-section. These stones are radiolucent."}]}

Normally, the principal sources of this acid are the erythrocytes (which lack the enzymes for aerobic oxidation), skeletal muscle, skin, and brain. The chief pathway for removal of lactic acid is by hepatic (and to some degree renal) uptake for conversion first to pyruvate and eventually back to glucose, a process that requires oxygen. Lactic acidosis occurs when excess lactic acid accumulates in the blood. This can be the result of overproduction (tissue hypoxia), deficient removal (hepatic failure), or both (circulatory collapse). Lactic acidosis is not uncommon in any severely ill patient suffering from cardiac decompensation, respiratory or hepatic failure, septicemia, or infarction of the bowel or extremities. Type A lactic acidosis is associated with tissue hypoxia from hypovolemia or endotoxic shock and need not be associated with hyperglycemia. Type B lactic acidosis is defined as that which occurs in the absence of clinical evidence for tissue hypoxia and is associated with diabetes per se or with biguanide therapy. With the discontinuance of phenformin therapy in the United States, lactic acidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus has become uncommon, but it still must be considered in the acidotic diabetic patient if the patient is seriously ill, and especially if the patient is receiving metformin therapy as well. Most cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occur in patients in whom there were contraindications to the use of metformin, in paicular renal failure."}]}

In maintenance of internal homeostasis (ie avoiding stress) and reproduction processes, multiple hormones cooperate to bring about organized biochemical & physiological responses. Stress Syndrome: CRH - ACTH - Coisol Axis The primitive signal of glucose (substrate) lack is expanded to a broder signal of fright or stress and evokes a coordinated neural and endocrine response. Any stressful event eg. surgery, infection, burn triggers a hypermetabolic state in which a resting energy expenditure is increased alongwith body temperature. CRH-ACTH - coisol axis is central to this integrated response to stress. Features of Stress Syndrome - Coicotropin releasing hormone (CRH) is increased in response to noxious environmental stimuli like pain, trauma, hypoglycemia, infection, surgery, hypovolemia. Various nervous impulses using several neuro transmitters (NTs) like norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine, and GABA reach CRH neurosecretory cells and cause release of CRH - In response to CRH, both ACTH and p endorphins (secreted 13-LPH & mature p-endorphin) are released in equimolar quantities 13-endorphin produce central analgesic response. - Glucagon & catecholamines (epinephrine & norepinephrine) are increased, stimulating glycogenolysis (glucose production in liver) for immediate use by critical organs such as the brain. - Coisol production is increased in adrenal coex which induces gluconeogenesis (glucose production from noncarbohydrate source like muscles & other body proteins) - Glucogon, epinephrine, ACTH and growth hormone (GH) stimulate lipolysis and free fatty acids (FFA) & ketones are released into the circulation to be used as an alternative metabolic fuel. - Insulin is suppressedQ that results in decrease in glucose utilization. - One form of stress that is cold, specially in neonate causes increased TRH secretion due to depressed metabolism of neurons in pre- optic area by cooling which release inhibitory discharge, permitting TRH secretion. - ADH (vasopressin), angiotensin & aldosterone synthesis is increased enhancing salt water retention - So increased glucose production (by glycogenolysis & gluconeogenesis) and decreased utilization of glucose results in hyperglycemia. There is marked increase in release of aminoacids from tissue protein, paicularly from skeletal muscle for gluconeogenesis. However, synthesis of specific proteins may increase - These metabolic changes are coordinated with increased sympathetic nervous system activity causing peripheral vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure."}]}

Orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are RNA viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome. The influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviruses. They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0.5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated. Some parainfluenza virus infections (type 3) may be indistinguishable from RSV, but most parainfluenza infections produce a laryngotracheobronchitis known as croup."}]}

The sentinel lymph node is the hypothetical first lymph node or group of nodes reached by metastasizing cancer cells from a primary tumor. Sentinel node biopsy technique is used in the staging of certain types of cancer to see if they have spread to any lymph nodes. It is done using lymphoscintigraphy with technetium-99m labeled nanocolloid or isosulfan blue dye to identify a sentinel node that would predict the presence or absence of regional nodal metastasis. The main advantage of this procedure is that it decreases unnecessary lymph node dissections, where it is not necessary, thereby reducing the risk of lymphedema and other complications. The main uses are in breast cancer and malignant melanoma surgery, although it has been used in other tumor types with a degree of success. Vulvar cancer was the first and most promising gynecological site for the sentinel lymph node biopsy strategy. As it involves a cutaneous tumor, peritumoral injections are easy and the sentinel lymph node is always located in the groin. This is another factor making the vulva an ideal site for sentinel lymph node biopsy. Preliminary studies indicate that a sentinel node can be identified in most of the patients of Ca vulva.

Apart from pelvic capacity there are several other factors involved in successful vaginal delivery. These are the fetal size, presentation, position and the force of uterine contractions. X-ray pelvimetry cannot assess the other factors. It cannot reliably predict the likelihood of vaginal delivery neither in breech presentation nor in cases with previous cesarean section.. X-ray pelvimetry is useful in cases with fractured pelvis and for the important diameters which are inaccessible to clinical examination. Techniques: For complete evaluation of the pelvis, three views are taken — anteroposterior, lateral and outlet. But commonly, X-ray pelvimetry is restricted to only the erect lateral view (the femoral head and acetabular margins must be superimposed) which gives most of the useful information. Anteroposterior view can give the accurate measurement of the transverse diameter of the inlet and bispinous diameter. Hazards of X-ray pelvimetry includes radiation exposure to the mother and the fetus. With conventional X-ray pelvimetry radiation exposure to the gonads is about 885 millirad.

Rationalization: Instead of accepting failure and correcting himself, the individual tries to make excuses and justifies his behaviour. It is like the proverbial fox declaring that the grapes were sour, when it could not reach them. This is called rationalization. It is a face-saving device. 2. Projection: Sometimes the individual blames others for his mistakes or failures.

For option a & c you should know the following impoant facts: o As I have explained in previous explanation; usually inactive confirmation (Ri) of receptor predominate in the absence of agonist and the signal output is low. If the preexisting or basal equilibrium for unliganded receptors lies far.in the direction of inactive confirmation (Ri), it may be very difficult to demonstrate inverse agonism because receptors are already existing in inactive state and inverse agonist has nothing to do (inverse agonist shifts the equilibrium towards inactive confirmation, but the receptors are already existing in inactive confirmation). o Some times receptor can adopt active confirmation (in the absence of agonist) that can produce a cellular response spontaneously -3 constitutional spontaneous activity without an agonist. In this situation, the tissue behaves as if there were agonist present. In this situation. i) Inverse agonism can be easily observed as inverse agonist shifts the equilibrium towards inactive state. So, it inhibits the agonist-independent constitutional signaling which can be easily observed. ii) Antagonist will have no effect as antagonist has equal affinity for active (Ra) as well as inactive (Ri) state of receptor. So, the equilibrium will remain the same. iii) It will be difficult to demonstrate activity of agonist as agonist shifts the equilibrium towards active confirmation, but the receptors are already existing in active confirmation (constitutional spontaneous active state). o Now you can easily understand: A. In usual resting stage (when inactive confirmation of receptor predominates in the absence of agonist) i) Agonism can be observed easily ii) Antagonism can be observed easily Inverse agonism is difficult to observe B.

The strength of the contractions of small intestine is propoional to the frequency of the spike generated by the slow waves 'Slow wave' amplitude is increased by GIT hormones released during digestion e.g. gastrin, CCK-PZ and motilin; whereas secretin and glucagons decrease the slow wave amplitude Intestinal motility Digestive hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and motilin increase intestinal motility Secretin decreases the activity. Serotonin and insulin can increase motility Glucagon can decrease motility. Secretin Secretin is synthesized in cytoplasmic secretory granules of S-cells which are found mainly in mucosa of duodenum and smaller numbers in jejunum of small intestine Secretin is released into circulation and/or intestinal lumen in response to low duodenal pH. Also the secretion of secretin is increased by the products of protein digestion bathing the mucosa of the upper small intestine. It is the active form of prosecretin. This acidity is due to hydrochloric acid in the chyme that enters the duodenum from the stomach the pyloric sphincter. Secretin targets the pancreas, which causes the organ to secrete a bicarbonate-rich fluid that flows into the intestine. Bicarbonate ion is a base that neutralizes the acid, thus establishing a pH orable to the action of other digestive enzymes in the small intestine and preventing acid burns. Other factors are also involved in the release of secretin such as bile salts and fatty acids, which result in additional bicarbonates being added to the small intestine. Secretin release is inhibited by H2 receptor antagonists, which reduce gastric acid secretion. As a result, if the pH in the duodenum increases above 4.5, secretin cannot be released Secretin increases water and bicarbonate secretion from duodenal Brunner's glands in order to buffer the incoming protons of the acidic chyme. It also enhances the effects of cholecystokinin to induce the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile from pancreas and gallbladder, respectively. It counteracts blood glucose concentration spikes by triggering increased insulin release from pancreas, following oral glucose intake. Although secretin releases gastrin from gastrinomas, it inhibits gastrin release from the normal stomach. It reduces acid secretion from the stomach by inhibiting gastrin release from G cells. In addition, secretin stimulates pepsin secretion from chief cells"}]}

Either one major or two minor criteria are necessary for indicating the presence of heart disease.. A) Major Criteria 1) Systolic murmur of grade III or more.  The systolic murmur is classified into : -.  Ejection systolic murmur Pansystolic murmur.  Pansystolic murmur is always abnormal no matter what is its intesity. Only three lesions produce pansystolic murmur. i) VSD ii) MR iii) TR. Ejection systolic murmur, on the other hand, may be organic or functional. If ejection systolic murmur is associated with thrill, it is always organic. If ejection systolic murmur is more than grade III intensity → It is organic. Grade III or less ejection systolic murmur of a functional type may be heard in anemia or high fever in otherwise normal children.. 2) Diastolic murmur. Presence of diastolic murmur always indicates the presence of organic heart disease. There are two exceptions..  Severe hypertension → Reduction of BP may cause an AR murmur to disappear. Anemia → May result in delayed diastolic murmur across the tricuspid and mitral area.. 3) Cyanosis. Central cyanosis indicates the presence of heart disease if lung disease has been excluded.. 4) CHF. Presence of CHF indicates the presence of heart disease except in neonates and infants who get CHF from causes such as hypoglycemia and anemia.. B) Minor criteria. Systolic murmur less than grade III in intensity. Abnormal second heart sound.  Abnormal S2 always indicates the presence of heart disease. It has been included as a minor criterion only because auscultation is an individual and subjective finding. 3) Abnormal ECG. The main value of ECG lies in determining the : -.  Mean QRS axis Right or left atrial hypertrophy Right or left ventricular hypertrophy. 4) Abnormal X-ray.  If there is cardiomegaly in a good inspiratory film, it is highly suggestive for the presence of heart disease.. 5) Abnormal BP"}]}

The situation given in the question is such that it points towards moderate endometriosis (as chocolate cyst, dense adhesions are present). Dense adhesions and cysts cannot be fully treated by medical therapy and so, some form of surgery is required. Main question is whether we would like to go for conservative surgery or Radical surgery (i.e. TAH with BSO). Conservative surgery : The clinical situations involving conservative surgery include ovarian endometrioma, pelvic adhesions, peritoneal implants and deep infiltrative recto vaginal septum disease. In addition laser laparoscopy can be used in order to perform uterine nerve ablation. .. Radical Surgery : Whilst repeated conservative surgery and medical therapy help many women, only some women fail to find pain relief after recurrence, which is the major drawback of conservative surgery. For these women, radical surgery is the only option and involves Hysterectomy with Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. According to \"Hysterectomy with bilateral oopherectomy should be reserved for women who have completed childbearing and recognise the risk of premature hypoestrogenism including possible osteoporosis and decrease libido.

The mediano A median is described as the value separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. It does not depend on the total, and number of items. To obtain the median, the data is first arranged in an ascending or discending order of magnitude, and then the value of the middle observation is located, which is called median. For example, diastolic BP of 9 individuals was as follows -83, 75, 81, 79,71, 95, 75, 77, 84. Now data is arranged in ascending order -71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 95. Here, 79 is the middle observation that is separating the upper four values from lower four values, so it is the median. If there are two values in the middle instead of one, the median is worked out by taking the average of the two middle values.o For example, If diastolic BP of 10 individuals is as follows 83, 75, 81, 79, 71, 95, 75, 77, 84, 90. Data is arranged in ascending order -71, 75, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 84, 90, 95. Here two values are separating the upper half of values from lower half. So the median here is Median =79 + 812 = 80. The value of median is not affected by abnormal very high or very low value. Taking the example as was taken in mean - The income of 7 people per day in rupees is as follows 5, 5, 5, 7, 10, 20, 300 = (Total 352). Here mean =50.3, median = 7. The value of mean has affected seriously, whereas median is not affected, and median is nearer to the truth. So, median is used when the distribution of values is skewed (deviated) with some small number of very high values - median is used for skewed distribution."}]}

The 5 most common primary sites are lung, breast, skin (melanoma), kidney and gastrointestinal tract, accounting for about 80% of all metastases.

Prostatic carcinoma Advanced prostate cancer can spread to other pas of the body, causing symptoms. The most common symptom is bone pain, often in the veebrae, pelvis, or ribs. Spread of cancer into other bones such as the femur is usually to the proximal pa of the bone. Prostate cancer in the spine can also compress the spinal cord, causing leg weakness and urinary and fecal incontinence Trophoblastic diseases They comprise a variety of biologically interrelated conditions which form a clinical spectrum consisting of four distinct clinical pathological entities like - Molar pregnancy Invasive mole - Placental site trophoblastic tumours and - Choriocarcinoma Incidence of hydatidiform mole ranges from 1 in 500 in India to 1 in 3000 in USA. Like wise malignant potential of the disease is also higher in Southeast Asia reaching as high as 10-15% compared to 2-4% in west. Some of the hydatidiform moles erode the wall of uterus, burrow into myometrium and may even burst though the uterus into peritoneum and are called invasive mole. Even though locally aggressive, invasive mole does not metastasise. On the other hand choriocarcinoma is rare but one of the most malignant neoplasms arising in the body of uterus. Choriocarcinoma metastasises readily. It is not uncommon to find secondary nodules in the cervix or vagina. The lungs, brain and liver are the distant organs more often involved. Lymph nodes are rarely the site of metastasis Brain metastases They are the most common type of brain tumors, with the total number diagnosed annually outnumbering all other intracranial tumors combined. The most common source of brain metastases in males is lung cancer and in females is breast cancer. The mechanisms by which primary tumors produce brain metastases is thought to be hematogenous spread from primary or secondary sites in the lung. Since the brain has no lymphatic system, all tumors metastasizing to the brain do so by spreading through the bloodstream. Aerial blood passes through the lungs before entering the brain, and collects tumor cells filtered out in capillaries, which subsequently embolize to the brain. Melanoma has the highest tendency to produce multiple lesions, followed by lung and breast cancers."}]}

The diagnosis of ovarian cancer is often delayed, because symptoms often do not occur until late in the disease when the mass is large and applies pressure to other abdominal organs. The symptoms illustrated in the case are typical. Patients may also develop ascites with shoness of breath, a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms related to impaired motility secondary to pressure, and, if the ovarian cancer is a type that secretes hormones, menstrual irregularities or abnormal hair growth. The most widely studied tumor marker in ovarian cancer is CA-125. This marker is not of paicular use in screening of the general population for two reasons: 1) small cancers often do not cause serum elevations of the marker; and 2) serum levels of the marker can be elevated by a variety of cancers (including those of ovary, breast, pancreas, colon, and lung) and benign conditions (including endometriosis, pregnancy, liver disease, and congestive hea failure). However, if there is already a strong suspicion or a known history of ovarian cancer, CA-125 can be helpful in establishing if the cancer burden (if present) is large, and whether following the CA-125 levels following surgery can be used to monitor for recurrent disease. While small tumors are not always picked up (50% of women with small ovarian cancers have normal CA-125), more than 80% of women with advanced ovarian cancer have CA-125 elevations. Adrenocoicotropic hormone can be elevated in ectopic hormone-producing lung cancers. Galactosyltransferase can be elevated in a wide variety of cancers, including those from lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and colon. It is not used as a marker for ovarian cancer.

Type II alveolar cells The low surface tension when the alveoli are small is due to the presence in the fluid lining the alveoli of surfactant, a lipid surface-tension-lowering agent. Surfactant is a mixture of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), other lipids, and proteins. If the surface tension is not kept low when the alveoli become smaller during expiration, they collapse in accordance with the law of Laplace. Surfactant is produced by type II alveolar epithelial cells. Typical lamellar bodies, membrane-bound organelles containing whorls of phospholipid, are formed in these cells and secreted into the alveolar lumen by exocytosis. Tubes of lipid called tubular myelin form from the extruded bodies, and the tubular myelin in turn forms the phospholipid film. Some of the protein-lipid complexes in surfactant are taken up by endocytosis in type II alveolar cells and recycled. Surfactant is impoant at bih. The fetus makes respiratory movements in utero, but the lungs remain collapsed until bih. After bih, the infant makes several strong inspiratory movements and the lungs expand. Surfactant keeps them from collapsing again. Surfactant deficiency is an impoant cause of infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS, also known as hyaline membrane disease), the serious pulmonary disease that develops in infants born before their surfactant system is functional. Maturation of surfactant in the lungs is accelerated by glucocoicoid hormones. Fetal and maternal coisol increase near term, and the lungs are rich in glucocoicoid receptors. Patchy atelectasis is also associated with surfactant deficiency in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery involving use of a pump oxygenator and interruption of the pulmonary circulation. In addition, surfactant deficiency may play a role in some of the abnormalities that develop following occlusion of a main bronchus, occlusion of one pulmonary artery, or long-term inhalation of 100% 0,. Cigarette smoking also decreases lung surfactant."}]}

Primary carcinoma of the gallbladder is an uncommon, aggressive malignancy that affects women more frequently than men. Older age groups are most often affected, and coexisting gallstones are present in the vast majority of cases. The symptoms at presentation are vague and are most often related to adjacent organ invasion. Imaging studies may reveal a mass replacing the normal gallbladder, diffuse or focal thickening of the gallbladder wall, or a polypoid mass within the gallbladder lumen. Adjacent organ invasion, most commonly involving the liver, is typically present at diagnosis, as is biliary obstruction. Peripoal and peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, hematogenous metastases, and peritoneal metastases may also be seen. The vast majority of gallbladder carcinomas are adenocarcinomas. Because most patients present with advanced disease, the prognosis is poor. The radiologic differential diagnosis includes the more frequently encountered inflammatory conditions of the gallbladder, xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis, adenomyomatosis, other hepatobiliary malignancies, and metastatic disease. The prevalence of lymphatic spread is high in gallbladder carcinoma. Lymphatic metastases progress from the gallbladder fossa through the hepatoduodenal ligament to nodal stations near the head of the pancreas. Three pathways of lymphatic drainage have been suggested: the cholecystoretropancreatic pathway, the cholecystoceliac pathway, and the cholecystomesenteric pathway. The cystic and pericholedochal lymph nodes are the most commonly involved at surgery and are a critical pathway to involvement of the celiac, superior mesenteric, and para-aoic lymph nodes."}]}

There are three phases in the secretion of gastric acid:The cephalic phase: Thirty percent of the total gastric acid secretions to be produced is stimulated by anticipation of eating and the smell or taste of foodThe gastric phase: Sixty percent of the acid secreted is stimulated by the distention of the stomach with food. Plus, digestion produces proteins, which causes even more gastrin productionThe intestinal phase: The remaining 10% of acid is secreted when chyme enters the small intestine, and is stimulated by small intestine distention. Regulation of secretionGastric acid production is regulated by both the autonomic nervous system and several hormones.The parasympathetic nervous system, the vagus nerve, and the hormone gastrin stimulate the parietal cell to produce gastric acid, both directly acting on parietal cells and indirectly, through the stimulation of the secretion of the hormone histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells (ECL).Vasoactive intestinal peptide, cholecystokinin, and secretin all inhibit production.The production of gastric acid in the stomach is tightly regulated by positive regulators and negative feedback mechanisms.Four types of cells are involved in this process: parietal cells, G cells, D cells and enterochromaffine-like cells.Besides this, the endings of the vagus nerve (CN X) and the intramural nervous plexus in the digestive tract influence the secretion significantly.Nerve endings in the stomach secrete two stimulatory neurotransmitters: acetylcholine and gastrin-releasing peptide. Their action is both direct on parietal cells and mediated through the secretion of gastrin from G cells and histamine from enterochromaffine-like cells.Gastrin acts on parietal cells directly and indirectly too, by stimulating the release of histamine.The release of histamine is the most impoant positive regulation mechanism of the secretion of gastric acid in the stomach.Its release is stimulated by gastrin and acetylcholine and inhibited by somatostatin."}]}

Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted to humans the bite of ixodes tick vector. Borrelia burgdorferi is inoculated in the skin, where local replication takes place locally and outward migration in the dermis occurs. - Days to week after the tick bite, hematogenous dissemination to secondary sites (like joints, hea eye, nervous system) takes place. If untreated, the bacteria may persist in the body for months or even years, despite the production of anti-Borrelia burgodorferi antibodies by the immune system. The following mechanisms have been described - i) Tick saliva, which accompanies the spirochete into the skin during the feeding process, contains substances that disrupt the immune response at the site of the bite. - This provides a protective environment where the spirochete can establish the infect on. ii) Once inside the body, Borrelia burgdorferi become; a stealth invader i.e., it changes shape. - In the tick and mice which host the bacterium through most of its life cycle, the bacterium has a thick cell wall and spiral shape. If it maintains its thick cell wall and its spiral shape, immune system can control infection. However, in the human body, it can shed its cell wall and can take a different shape. When under attack from immune system, it simply changes shape so it is not recognized. iii) Borrelia burgdorferi produces antigenic variation in a 'cell surface lipoprotein VIsE', during the course of infection - The VIsE system presents a challenge to immune system because after an immune response is generated to one version of VISE protein, a different version is quickly produced. By using this type of antigenic variation, B. burgdorferi can escape the adaptive immune system. Lyme meningitis Meningitis (meningeal involvement) is the most common neurological event that occurs in the setting of early lyme dissemination. - In this clinical setting CSF is always abnormal and shows: 1) Pleocytosis with predominantly lymphocytosisQ (not polymorphonuclear leukocytosis). 2) Increased protein 3) Glucose content is usually normal, but it .falls below the serum concentration in 20% of patients.

D i.e. CECT Imaging for pleural effusion Chest X-ray Chest X-rays have long been the initial radiologic investigation for the assessment of pulmonary pathology including the presence of pleural space infections. The chest X-ray will usually show a small to moderate effusion with or without parenchymal infiltrates. Prior to the greater use of thoracic ultrasound and CT, lateral decubitus X-rays were used in the assessment of pleural collection, USG There is a significant trend worldwide to employ pleural ultrasound at the bedside to assess for the presence of pleural effusions, especially in the context of pleural infection. Pleural ultrasound is fast, safe and effective in confirming the presence of pleural fluid, and in localising the optimal site for diagnostic and therapeutic intervention in real time). CT scan Pleural effusions are commonly detected on review of CTs organised for assessment of pneumonia. In terms of diagnosis and planning of intervention, contrast enhanced thoracic CT is the imaging investigation of choice, with correct timing of contrast injection allowing better definition of the pleural abnormalities Thoracic CT allows not only assessment of the pleura itself, but chest tube position, presence and degree of loculations, parenchymal changes, endobronchial lesions and differentiation of lung abscess from empyema MRI MRI is not routinely used for the assessment of the pleural space, though it has been shown to allow assessment of complex loculated effusions, and demonstrate chest wall involvement"}]}

Raised IgG level Asthma Bronchial asthma is a disease characterized by an increased responsiveness of airways to a variety of stimulus and causes recurrent attacks of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and cough.

Asthma is the commonest chronic illness during childhood. o It is a type I hypersensitivity, which is mediated by IgE IgE is raised (not IgG) Risk factors o Family history of asthma o Family history of atopic disease (Atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis). Bronchiolitis during infancy. Sensitization to allergenes (dust mite, animal danders, cockroaches and alternaria) during childhood. Passive smoking Response of Asthmatic patients to exercise ? Mild exercise i.e., running for 1-2 minutes caused bronchodilation in asthmatic patients and can reduce wheezing (wheezing is produced due to obstruction in bronchi). Severe exercise will cause bronchoconstriction in viually all asthmatic patients and will aggravate wheezing. Prognosis of Asthma ? The prognosis of young asthmatic children is generally good. Longitudinal studies indicate that in patients who have mild asthma the remission rate is about 50% i.e., 50% of them will be asthma free in their adulthood. In severe asthma characterized by chronic steroid dependent disease, the remission rate is very less. About 95% of them will develop into asthmatic adults."}]}

In Neisseria, the equivalent to LPS is Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) (c), which consists of lipid A and core oligosaccharide but lacks the O antigen. By triggering an inflammatory response, LOS causes most of the symptoms during Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection. It activates the complement and stimulates the influx of phagocytes leading to the purulent discharge. LOS also contributes to serum resistance, which is an important feature of strains that causes systemic infection. Rapidly growing Neisseria releases outer membrane blebs, which contain LOS. Pili (e) mediate the initial attachment of N. gonorrhoeae to the surface of cervical or urethral epithelial cells. Pili are attached to the cell surface and are not released. The opacity protein (d), which provides N. gonorrhoeae colonies with their opaque appearance, is an outer membrane protein. It mediates binding of N. gonorrhoeae to epithelial cells and plays a role in cell-to-cell signaling. Similar to the pili, the opacity protein is a cell-associated factor. The capsule (a) surrounds pathogenic bacteria and provides them with antiphagocytic properties. However, N. gonorrhoeae is not encapsulated.

Pudendal nerve (in the pelvis)The pudendal nerve arises from the ventral divisions of the second, third and fourth sacral ventral rami and is formed just above the superior border of the sacrotuberous ligament and the upper fibres of ischiococcygeus. It leaves the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen between piriformis and ischiococcygeus, enters the gluteal region and crosses the sacrospinous ligament close to its attachment to the ischial spine, where it lies medial to the internal pudendal vessels. It accompanies the internal pudendal artery through the lesser sciatic foramen into the pudendal (Alcock's) canal on the lateral wall of the ischio-anal fossa. In the posterior part of the canal it gives rise to the inferior rectal nerve, the perineal nerve and the dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris.b. Inferior rectal nerveThe inferior rectal nerve runs through the medial wall of the pudendal canal with the inferior rectal vessels. It crosses the ischio-anal fossa to supply the external anal sphincter, the lining of the lower part of the anal canal, and the circumanal skin. It frequently breaks into terminal branches just before reaching the lateral border of the sphincter. Its cutaneous branches distributed around the anus overlap the cutaneous branches of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve and of the scrotal or labial nerves. The inferior rectal nerve occasionally arises directly from the sacral plexus and crosses the sacrospinous ligament or reconnects with the pudendal nerve. In females, the inferior rectal nerve may supply sensory branches to the lower part of the vagina.c. Perineal nerveThe perineal nerve is the inferior and larger terminal branch of the pudendal nerve in the pudendal canal. It runs forwards below the internal pudendal artery and accompanies the perineal artery, dividing into posterior scrotal or labial and muscular branches. The posterior scrotal or labial nerves are usually double and have medial and lateral branches which run over the perineal membrane and pass forwards in the lateral part of the urogenital triangle with the scrotal or labial branches of the perineal artery. They supply the skin of the scrotum or labia majora, overlapping the distribution of the perineal branch of the posterior femoral cutaneous and inferior rectal nerves. In females, the posterior labial branches also supply sensory fibres to the skin of the lower vagina.Muscular branches arise directly from the pudendal nerve to supply the superficial transverse perinei, bulbospongiosus, ischiocavernosus, deep transverse perinei, sphincter urethrae and the anterior parts of the external anal sphincter and levator ani. In males, a nerve to the bulb of the urethra leaves the nerve to the bulbospongiosus, pierces this muscle to supply the corpus spongiosum penis and ends in the urethral mucosa.d. Dorsal nerve of the penis or clitorisThe dorsal nerve of the penis or clitoris runs anteriorly above the internal pudendal artery along the ischiopubic ramus deep to the perineal membrane. It supplies the corpus cavernosum and accompanies the dorsal artery of the penis or clitoris between the layers of the suspensory ligament. In males, the dorsal nerve of the penis runs on the dorsum of the penis to end in the glans. In females the dorsal nerve of the clitoris is very small."}]}

It may be used in barbiturate poisoning as it acts on the same receptor i.e. GABAA Flumazenil is a highly selective competitive antagonist at benzodiazepine receptors so does not oppose sedation due to non benzodiazepine e.g., barbiturates alcohol. Gamma AminoButyric acid (GABA) is the most impoant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the C.N.S. comprising up of 40% of all synapses. Its main action is to inhibit transmission along neurons in which they are present. Normally proper functioning of the brain is ensured by a balance between the action of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. - Simply put, excitatory neurotransmitters conduct the impulses forward where as inhibitory neurotransmitters do not conduct the impulse ,forward. The GABAA receptor not only binds to the endogenous ligand GABA but is also the binding site for various other external ligands such as Benzodiazepenes, Barbiturates. (GABAA receptor has several binding sites) An impoant point to emphasize here is that though the benzodiazepine drugs bind to GABAA receptors; their binding site is distinct from the binding site of the endogenous GABA ligand. - In fact, it produces different effect on binding too. - When Benzodiazepenes bind to its site on the GABA receptor it does not directly increase the entry of chlorides rather it enhances the effectiveness of GABA producing a larger inhibitory effect. Other drugs that act on the GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complex Barbiturates too act on the GABAA receptor. - But their site of action is different from Benzodiazepenes. They also enhance the GABA.function but at high doses have the additional capacity directly to open the membrane chloride channel. This explains why barbiturates and alcohol are more toxic in overdose than the benzodiazepenes. Not only the binding site of benzodiazepenes is distinct from Barbiturates but the mechanism of action too is different. Benzodiazepenes Causing burst of chloride channel opening to occur more often. Barbiturates Causing duration of bursts of chloride channel opening to become longer. It is evident from the above diagram that though benzodiazepem and barbiturates act on the same receptor i.e., GABAA -benzodiazepem receptor complex, their binding site is site is quite distinct from each other. Once again, Even though benzodiazepenes and barbiturates act on the same receptor their binding site on the receptor is quite distinct from each other. - Flumazenil is highly selective competitive antagonist at benzodiazepene receptor, so it does not oppose sedation due to non benzodiazepenes e.g., barbiturates, alcohol. An impoant point: ? There is ceain other class of hypnotic that act on the same receptor site as the benzodiazepens on the GABAA benzodiazepene receptor complex, 50 their action too is blocked by Benzodiazepene antagonist i.e., Flumazenil. Non Benzodiazepene hypnotics that act at the GABAA- Benzodiazepene receptor complex. - Zopiclone - Zolpidem - Zaleplon"}]}

Perseveration:- repetition of words, or motor activity beyond the point of relevance. You should keep in mind that in perseveration, there may be a repetition of speech (words, phrases) or motor activity (movement) or both. Stereotype: -A continuous mechanical repetition of speech or physical activity which is not goal oriented and occurs in the absence of any external stimulus. Now, you must be thinking that both perseveration and stereotypy are a repetitive motor activity or speech, Then what is the difference between them ? Read below -.  Perseveration is goal-directed (However, it is repeated beyond the fulfillment of goal), on the other hand, stereotypy is not goal-directed. Perseveration requires an external stimulus, but stereotypy does not..  For example:-.  If you ask the person `QI - What is your name?' Ansi- Ramesh'. Q2 - 'Where are you'. Ans2 - 'Ramesh'. Q3 ­'What is the Day'. Ans 3 - 'Ramesh'. This is an example of perseveration. Here the external stimulus is given by asking the Question and the person gave a goal-directed answer. However, he repeated the same answer again, i.e. repetition beyond the fulfillment of a goal. In stereotypy, a person continuously repeats speech eg. by saying 'you are old & sick', 'you are old & sick', 'you are old & sick', without any external stimulus. The speech is not goal-directed."}]}

Here I am giving you all details of HPV. Human papilloma virus is a non enveloped DNA virus with a protein capsid It is epihelio tropic and has high affinity for lower ano genital tract. Maximum age of incidence of HPV is under 25 years. Viral Life Cycle : The HPV genome consist of early genes (E) and late genes (L). Early genes are expressed most strongly within the basal and parabasal layers. The late genes encoding capsid proteins are expressed later in superficial layers. Intact virus is shed within superficial squama. Late genes are not strongly expressed in high grade neoplastic lesions. Transmission. It is transmitted by sexual contact with genital skin, mucus membrane or body fluids of a paner with either was or subclinical infection. Congenital HPV infection by veical transmission from mother to infant develops rarely. Conjunctival, laryngeal, vulvar or peineal was present at bih are most likely due to perinatal exposure to maternal HPV in absence of sexual abuse. Infection is not related to the presence of maternal genital was or route of delivery. So caesarean delivery is recommended only in case of large genital was that would obstruct delivery or avulse with cervical dilation. Diagnosis is made by the direct detection of HPV DNA. This can be done histologically by in situ hybridization (ISH), by nucleic acid amplification PCR; or by hybrid capture (HC) technique. Currently, Hybrid capture 2 is the most common technique in clinical use. It is a chemiluminescent test that uses a mixture of RNA probes for the detection of 13 oncogenic HPV types."}]}
