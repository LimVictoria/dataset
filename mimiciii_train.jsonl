Notably, germ cell marker HCG neg, AFP normal. He had a bronchoscopy with BAL which was negative for pathogens (some still pending) or eosinophilic predominance.

Cardiac enzymes were elevated (CK 524, MB 45, TnI 2.8). He was given ASA 325mg, Plavix 600mg load, and heparin/integrillin/nitro gtt's and transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization.  Cardiac catheterization revealed totally occluded RCA with thrombus and 90% proximal LAD lesion. Thrombectomy was attempted but aborted as clot nearly dislodged during extraction. Angiojet was performed with distal embolization of the thrombus which was then stented with a cypher. Final recanalization revealed TIMI 3 flow with distal PDA cutoff likely due to thrombus.  Of note, during the cath the patient was in sinus bradycardia and briefly developed junctional escape rhythm in the 30's requiring atropine. He is transferred to the CCU for close monitoring for heart block in the setting of STEMI and complicated cath.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY: 1)HTN 2)Hypercholesterolemia 3)tobacco abuse 4)GERD 5)Gout 6)BPH\n\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: Atenolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **] Zocor 20mg qd Hytrin 5mg qd Omeprazole 20mg qd Allopurinol 300mg qd\n\nALLERGIES: Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: vitals T 97.4 HR 70 BP 128/72 RR 14 SaO2 97% RA General: WDWN, NAD, breathing comfortably on RA HEENT: PERRL, EOMi, anicteric sclera, conjunctivae pink Neck: supple, trachea midline, no thyromegaly or masses, no LAD Cardiac: RRR, s1s2 normal, no m/r/g, no JVD Pulmonary: CTAB Abdomen: +BS, soft, nontender, nondistended, no HSM Extremities: warm, 2+ DP pulses, no edema Neuro: A&Ox3, speech clear and logical, CNII-XII intact, moves all extremities\n\nFAMILY HISTORY: MI in brother (50's) and father (40's)\n\nSOCIAL HISTORY: Retired gasterenterologist.

The patient is unable to provide history at the time of ED presentation, but per her son who later arrived and who lives with her, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had been complaining of abdominal pain for the past week.   Of note, she had been administered 2g of vancomycin intraperitoneally [**9-13**] at [**Location (un) 4265**] where she receives peritoneal dialysis (no gram stain or culture data is available, and it is unclear from disucssions with the renal fellow why antiobiotics were administered).  She apparently only received one dose of IP antibiotics at [**Location (un) 4265**]. Per her son, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was evaluated for abdominal pain and fatigue at [**Hospital6 **] ED several days prior to this presentation for abdominal pain and lethargy, was given fluids, though was not admitted.  Mrs.[**Name (NI) 14386**] son also noted drainage and irration around the PD exit site and was told to apply antibiotic ointment to the area, which he did.  However, the patient continued per report to experience abdominal pain.  The morning of admission was noted to be increasingly lethargic, with worsening abdominal pain, and was brought to the ED for further evaluation.  On ED admission, she was noted to be hypothermic (T=33.7 C), hypotensive. (BP 92/50), tachycardic (HR 130s), and hypoxic, tachypnic (RR in the 30s), with initial O2 sat 63% in the ED (noted to be hypoxic in the field, started on NRB prior to ED presentation).  Initial blood glucoses were in the 70s. Unsuccessful attempts were made at placemet of femoral CVL, and and left EJ IV was placed.  The patient was intubated for respiratory failure.  She was given saline boluses for a total of 4L of NS, with minimal increase in blood pressure.  Initial serum lactate was 8.9.  The source of the sepsis was unknown, though felt possibly to be a secondary to a peritoneal infection, given her localizing symptom of abdominal pain: pritoneal fluid was drained, revealing purulent fluid that on analysis demonstrated 17,000 WBC, though negative gram stain. The patient was given levofloxacin 500 mg IV, flagyl 500mg IV, and vancomycin 1g IV (ceftriaxone was not given, as the patient has a history of cephalosporin and PCN allergy). The renal team was consulted, and the patient was also given intraperitoneally 2 grams of vancomycin and 30mg of gentamycin.  A surgerical consult was obtained, with plans for removal of the PD catheter when patient stable enough for the procedure.  As the patient remained hypotensive despite fluid challagnes, she was started on Levophed.  A L subclavian central line was placed. The patient was started on empiric dexamethasone as per the sepsis protocol, and was also started on an insulin drip for tight glycemic control.  Though an anion gap acidosis was present, she was acetone negative.  As above, the decision was made by the ED staff to intubate the patient for respiratory failure.  As initial attempts at contacting family were unsuccessful, the patient was intubated in the ED, and begun on CMV ventillation.  However, when contact with family were acheived, the family (including HCP) stated that patient had voiced a definite DNR/DNI advanced directive. A family meeting was held between the ED staff and the family, and at the wishes of the patient's family, the patient was extubated.  Her post-extubation ABG was: pH 7.19/PaCo2=33/PaO2=66 (intubated ABG pH 7.20/ PaCO2=27/PaO2=470). The family (including HCP) again explained that the patient was to be DNR/DNI, though they desired otherwise aggressive medical therapy, including vasopressor usage as necessary.  Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was also noted in the ED to have an irregular atrial tachycardic rhythm that appeared to be new-onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (with rates up to the 140-150s), with inferiolateral ischemic changes.   She ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak troponin I of 1.45, peak CK of 704, peak CK-MB of 53, peak MB index of 8.7. Attempts were made to wean off the Levophed as tolerated, given its beta-agonistic effects, and she appeared to reconvert to NSR with rates in the 90s-100s.  The patient was given further fluid boluses (carefully, given the DNI status and ESRD), and vasopressin was initiated to maintain adequate blood pressure. As she has an aspirin allergy, no aspirin was administered (she does however take Plavix).  Given her hypotension/sepsis, no beta-blockers were initiated.\n\nMEDICAL HISTORY: ESRD, on peritoneal dialysis DM II CAD (no cardiac catheterizations), +stress test. s/p MVR PVD s/p bilateral AKA DMII HTN COPD asthma DVT and PE MRSA bacteremia endocarditis breast cancer, s/p mastectomy s/p TAH/BSO\n\nMEDICATION ON ADMISSION: Ipratropium inh Albuterol inh folic acid Timolol eye drops Midodrine 2.5 by mouth [**Hospital1 **] Sevelamer 800 PO TID Metoprolol PO 25 BID Plavix 75 PO QD Protonix 40 QD Nephrocaps\n\nALLERGIES: Aspirin / Penicillins / Percocet / Benzodiazepines / Cephalosporins\n\nPHYSICAL EXAM: T=34.1, BP 97/55 (on 20 of Levophed), HR 117 RR 30 100% on RA Patient found lying in semi-recumbant position, frequently groaning, though laying still.
