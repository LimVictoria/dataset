In majority of the cases , genetic problems or some congenital defects are the causes behind miscarriages up to 14 weeks of pregnancy. Genetic screening and chromosomal analysis can be done for both partners , but is not routinely advisable. 3 ) as you have mentioned that you have one full term pregnancy, please do not worry. I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products and refined sugars. Use of vitamin B12, folic acid and omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. I hope this answer helps you."}]}

Your clinical history is concerned, please follow like this - 1) Do a clinical examination by your doctor [rheumatologist] and to confirm do X-ray and MRI scan  2) Do take OTC painkiller [naproxen] and do consult with your physiotherapist for specific exercise plan  3)if conservative treatment failed to solve your problem then go for [cortisone shots and lubrication injections]. Do follow lifestyle modifications like this - 1) Exercise. Exercise can increase your endurance and strengthen the muscles around your joint, making your joint more stable. Try walking, or swimming  2) try to lose weight. Being overweight or obese increases the stress on your weight-bearing joints, such as your knees and your hips  3) apply over-the-counter pain creams. Creams and gels available at drugstores may provide temporary relief from pain  4) Use assistive devices.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, plan b or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? and at what dosage?."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of yasmin (combination of ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query. All the best."}]}

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of yasmin (combination of ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The bigger brown patch is cafe-au-lait macule and the small one is probably an atypical nevus (attachment removed to protect patient identity). That is not melanoma clinically to me.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? how long until it is out of our system? how long does cocaine stay in sperm? thanks in advance.."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello. There are few researches / studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? secondly, how long he has been taking it? for you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? if you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and mdma completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck."}]}

So inspite of the good health, management of dog bite demands an immediate cleaning of wound with antiseptic liquid, spirit, cotton soaked (and squeezed) with warm water / application of antibiotic ointment / changing dressing daily in case it is bandaged (with autoclaved pad & bandage). Injection of anti rabies vaccine(rabipur) to be started immediately in case of stray dog bite / in case of pet dog bite who is already vaccinated, rabipur can be skipped.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? how long until it is out of our system? how long does cocaine stay in sperm? thanks in advance.."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "There are few researches / studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time, it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues / or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? secondly, how long he has been taking it? for you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? if you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and mdma completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck. "}]}

Microvascular ischemia is a radiographic finding that shows as very small 'dots' or 'spots' on the image of a brain scan which is usually an Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Such a condition is not uncommonly seen in normal subjects without any history of medical problems or complaints just based on normal aging (20-35% in healthy subjects). It represents the aggregate result of microscopic blood vessel deterioration causing the tiniest amounts of deprivation of oxygenated blood to brain tissue. This is generally not a problem and is not likely to lead to what most people understand as serious stroke unless being caused by things which can lead to strokes if not truly controlled such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, etc. There are multiple associated conditions with this entity (aside from what I just mentioned) such as high cholesterol, aging, atherosclerosis, heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and the list goes on and on. There is no definitive treatment. Neurologists tend not to get terribly excited when this read is made since treatment is generally directed at risk factor control or the condition is severe in its amount of brain territory covered (which the radiologist will usually say in the report). I try not to prescribe anything for the most part since there are risks to taking things such as aspirin, plavix, or aggrenox (the most commonly used agents) and again, if the person is otherwise healthy and the finding was incidental I simply educate the patient as to what it means and how best to control associated risks as those listed above.

Avoid caffeine, alcohol and smoking as these can make panic attacks worse. Panic support groups like no panic have useful advice about how you can effectively manage your attacks. Knowing that other people are experiencing the same feelings can be reassuring. Cognitive behavioral therapy (cbt) can identify and change the negative thought patterns that are feeding your panic attacks. How to handle a panic attack - tell yourself that the symptoms you're experiencing are caused by anxiety. Don't look for distractions. Ride out the attack. Try to keep doing things. If possible, don't leave the situation until the anxiety has subsided. Confront your fear. If you don't run away from it, you're giving yourself a chance to discover that nothing's going to happen. As the anxiety begins to pass, start to focus on your surroundings and continue to do what you were doing before. If you’re having a short, sudden panic attack, it can be helpful to have someone with you, reassuring you that it will pass and the symptoms are nothing to worry about. Consult your doctor for further treatment. Hope this was helpful."}]}

If the gum is sore and red and there is no pain in the tooth with previous history of gum disease then the symptoms are probably due to localised gum infection only.

So my suggestion is to consult a dentist and get the localised gum cleaning done followed by gum paint application. To reduce soreness you can also apply lidocaine gel over it,you can also do warm saline gargles and apply cold compresses over the area to reduce inflammation..you can also take anti inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen if there is considerable pain."}]}

First of all, please understand that conventional medical specialists cannot prevent a disease from worsening because they want some material findings to interfere with. I am a homoeopath and so will be sharing with you some different thoughts about your disease. You become sick because of your miasms. This is a term we homoeopaths use. This simply means a genetic disposition transferred through generations and you got it from your parents. This dynamic proneness for certain types of diseases are inborn. It is your life situations and  dynamically decided reactions that precipitate the disease. Now coming back to your query, you have not mentioned a single word about your mind, because for the conventional medicine, mind is insignificant or they do not know the importance of mind in the production of diseases. Man is both mind and body. How can we imagine health without considering one's mind and body together? similarly how can we say that mind is not important in sickness. You gave a lot of information about investigations but what about your mind?as a homoeopath, I can presume that you had a psychological conflict, something that you could not \"digest\", just before the development of the complaints in your abdomen. You kept it in your mind without resolving in the psychological level. There are centres in the brain corresponding to every emotion and every organ. The mind- brain- organ axis makes the disease; the location and type of disease is decided by one's miasm.in your case, the liver is affected. The tendency to develop tumours is in your genetics. It started with small cyst, now developed to larger haemangioma. Your gastro enterologist can do nothing except cutting the tumour. Haemangioma is not a safe organ to be meddled with surgical interference. Since they have dropped the ball, I can take it up again, because we never treat your haemangioma, cyst or abdomen. We treat you and you only.we pay more importance to your genetic disposition to develop tumour, of course. But your life situations, your mental and physical reactions, your particular  psychological conflicts that precipitated the disease, your past history, family history, mental and physical make ups etc are most important while taking your case. A rightly chosen genetic constitutional remedy will cure your haemangioma without any surgery. Please do not imagine that cure is its total disappearance or that you will become healthy only by removing it. Understand that your body has innumerable defence mechanisms and even now you are 'almost' compromised with the tumour. The balance of uncompromising is manifested through your present pains and other discomforts. You have to get your psychological conflicts resolved in the psychological level itself. After taking the homoeopathic remedy, once you stop getting pains and other discomforts, understand that you have started improving. Wait for days when your body will keep the haemangioma to a stage from where it started coming up. Let is take time. But you can ignore about it under homoeopathic treatment. No need of any removal. Rather, I would advise you never go for any surgery.either you can approach a very expert homoeopathic physician or you can approach me by asking a direct premium question through healthcare magic. I will then send to you a case taking format in which you will develop your whole history and send it back to me. Then I will suggest your miasmatic / genetic constitutional remedy which will cure you."}]}

The abnormal vaginal discharge usually resuts from the infection in vagina or infection in cervix,uterus and fallopian tubes which is called pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). Lower abdominal pain is usually associated with pid than with the infection in vagina alone so in your case chances of pid seems more than the infection in the vagina alone as your vaginal discharge is yellow in colour, itchy and associated with lower abdominal pain even if it is not foul smelling .pid has no relationship with the implant removal but may be related to iucd, number of sexual partners, general hygiene mantainance, douching techanique and other factors. So you can have a gynecological consultation done where by the doctor may advice you following test and treatement. Usg abdomen .urine routine and microscopy .std screening tests .cervical swab for gram stain and culture and sentivity .mean while you can receive following treatement .tab ciprofloxacin tinidazole , one tab twice daily after meals.

How are you doing? yes, as you have heard, yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of yasmin (combination of ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are doctor advising patient"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Hello doctor, I am a 34-year-old male in good general health. Until 20 years of age, I never experienced any issue with erections or sexual health. When I turned 20, I had an episode with my girlfriend where over two consecutive nights, we had no sex, but rather very prolonged foreplay. Due to the prolonged arousal, my erection stayed for most of the night, without ejaculation. This episode of two prolonged erections and arousal obviously hurt my penis as it went through some visible changes back then, both in shape and feeling. While it was not painful, it lost some thickness and the side erectile tissue eventually lost some elasticity, becoming somewhat hardened in a flaccid state. Since a slight curvature initially appeared, I can only guess this was peyronie’s. Eventually, in the course of some years, it did recover partially and as of now, there is practically no curvature at all. However, the erectile tissue is still not as it used to be, somewhat hardened and when I have an erection, the blood seems to get trapped in a way in both sides of the penis, while the glans have difficulties getting sufficient blood and arousal and often remains softer. I have no problems getting and maintaining an erection myself, but when being with a partner, it tends to be more difficult and the erection often goes away quickly if not actively stimulated. The softer glans often leads to less control and premature ejaculation. I assume I may have gotten some degree of penile fibrosis, which was triggered by the episode of prolonged erection when I was 20. My question is, would there be a (natural) way to help reduce this tissue hardening and enhance regular blood flow, particularly to the glans. Since this is not a serious issue and it seems the damage was not that substantial (i still have morning erections for example, and the feeling is often close to normal), I would be looking to some natural therapy with as little side effects as possible. I read about some allegedly very good results of combining l-arginine and pine bark extract when it comes to enhancing erection quality overall. Would you happen to know about this or could you recommend some other natural treatment options, which would not cause any other health issues? my main concern would be getting priapism due to some medicine like viagra, as it was exactly the prolonged erection that caused my problems. If arginine and pine bark extract are overall safe, I would be glad to opt for this.."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. From the events you described, you had normal erection and ejaculation but over the years it has reduced. You have difficulty in maintaining erection and premature ejaculation. Have you recently changed the partner or stress in relationship? how much time do you take before ejaculation (intravaginal)? natural extracts are effective but the effect may not be titrated as per the dose and excessive may lead to possible priapism. With progressive exposure to more sexual experience, the quality of erection goes down, but a person becomes more confident to satisfy a female. For a female, the way of doing sex and getting her to orgasm is more important than the penis solely. For you, I would suggest tadaflo 5 mg (low dose tadalafil used in bph patients) as you do not have erectile dysfunction but need to support erection for a few days. Premature ejaculation if persistent problem, I may treat that later. Tablet tadalafil 5 mg on alternate days evening."}]}

My 5 year old son has been having random skin symptoms that seem to occur every couple months. He is currently having them now and I am wondering if I need to take him to an allergist to be tested. The last time before this I took him to his pediatrician several times with in a week. She was convinced that it was bug bites. It started with a large welt that appeared on the tip of his ear resembling a mosquito bite. He then got more behind his ear. The next morning he had several on his back side and legs. The ones on his legs then formed water blisters. When I took him the first time they told me they were bites and sent me home. I took him back the same day because between the doctors office and home new bumps formed. She still was convinced they were bites. I had an exterminator out who cleared us of any bugs. After 2 weeks of the bumps turning to blisters, scabing over, new forming and then clearing the symptoms stopped for a few months. Just a week ago his father found a spider on his head in the car. He had 4 bites behind his ear after. One on his leg and one on his back that both formed blisters and scabbed over. Thinking maybe the doctor was right, I left them to heal. A few days later he woke with three new bumps on his back again looking like bites. They have swelled and I m sure again will form water blisters then scab over. I am just not convinced these are bug bites. My concern is he his having a reaction to some contact with something he is sensitive to or having a food reaction. I apologize if my letter is scattered, I can t seem to pin point this in anyway. Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you. Sent from yahoo mail on android."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi...

As your mother is advised with tkr, I think in many of the cases tkr can be delayed or avoided even depending upon the clinical findings. As your mother is 64 years old, there will be some degenerative changes happening within the joint which may lead to damage of cartilages within the knee joint. If the x-ray has revealed no joint space most surgeons will recommend tkr as to reduce the pain levels. Also, due to knee pain, there will be changed in normal gait mechanism leading to stress and strain on the spinal column leading to back pains.in my clinical practice, most patients never underwent surgery even after the x-ray was indicating the tkr. As we follow a strict protocol to rehabilitate the knee and back to make sure the surgery is avoided to 99%.also, in my practice many patients been seen under me who had a prescription of advice for tkr but never underwent. The first foremost thing we did is a thorough clinical examination and then used the diagnostics for understanding the knee mechanism and predicted the outcome score. Infact we got more than we expected.many patients coming to me with similar complaints are actually having a functionally active life style like jogging. We never underwent surgery.if you can provide me some more details I would be happy to help your mother and regain the full knee mobility.regardsjay indravadan patel."}]}

If symptoms are too severe we can go for tonsil and adenoid surgery now also. Flonase is a steroid and it does not affect growth as it will be administered inside the nostril and will have the action only there. There will not be any systemic or bloodstream absorption. How much worried you should be about his tonsil and sleep apnea problem are: 1. Change in facial features producing adenoid facies. 2. Irritability of kid. 3. He cannot hear properly due to adenoids blocking ear tubes. 4. Ear discharge. 5. Reduced development of speech. Do not get worried just because of the snoring and sleep apnea. Give him nasal steroids and antihistaminic syrup (like zyrtec or allegra syrup) of appropriate dosage. In some cases, we even give oral steroid syrup. It does not cause any stunting the way you have understood. Once you exhaust the above medical treatment option and find no or not much benefit we can discuss about the surgery. Your doctor is right in giving the medicines flonase, etc. That is the protocol. We can follow the same here. The decision to operate may vary with different surgeon.

Sit in about three inches of warm water for 15 minutes, several times a day, especially after a bowel movement. This helps reduce the swelling in the area and relaxes spasm of the sphincter muscle. Include lot of bananas, fruits, salads, green leafy vegetables. Raisins soaked in water will also help in good bowel movements.

As you have already tried for 4 years, you now need some medical help to conceive. Get a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries done. Also do a semen analysis of your husband. If everything is fine, you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound. When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles. Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection. Take progesterone for next 2 weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that. You can try like that for 3 to  6 months. Hope I have answered your question."}]}

It is very possible that this should not be sue to a problem with the physical nature of the stomach or your intestines. It is a functional problem, meaning that it arises mainly due to some abnormalities in contraction of intestines. There are moments when can experience either very strong or very weak contractions with corresponding consequences on digestion. This either increases or reduces the movement of food along the intestines. Depending on the time spent, some bacteria, especially in the large intestines feed on this food, and produce lots of gas. Eventual passage of gas could relieve symptoms in some people. This could be seen in irritable bowel syndrome.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query. For further queries consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist."}]}

I can understand your concern. No, smoking is strictly contraindicated in patients with tuberculosis. Smoking is the risk factor for lung and pleural infection. Smoking causes irritation and inflammation. These weaken lung defense system and make you vulnerable for infection. The cause for your tubercular infection is mostly smoking. So better not to smoke because you are already having an infection. If you continue smoking, healing rate will decrease and you may need longer duration. You may also develop drug resistant tuberculosis. So better to quit smoking as soon as possible. It is not a good habit. It will only damage. So avoid smoking. Hope I have solved your query.

I read that yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? and at what dosage?."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi. Yes, as you have heard, yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of yasmin (combination of ethinyl estradiol and drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

My chiropractor found my stomach is pushed up very high, next to my esophagus. He was able to push it back down, but with a lot of painful force and manipulation. Ever since I have been getting sicker and sicker with episodes that are so debilitating that I can no longer work. They happened occasionally at first, but now three to four times each day (always upon weakening) and last for hours at a time. It begins in my mid-abdomen. I feel and see pulsating in my abdomen and get a wet sensation as though the fluid is leaking out of my chest or belly. If I push on that area (or usually all by itself), I get an instant rush of blood to my head and start to feel fuzzy. My face turns bright red and becomes so hot that I get nauseous. The redness sometimes stays, sometimes goes away. But what always follows immediately is intense heat throughout my whole body, like my spine, muscles, and nerves are on fire everywhere from my head to my palms to my mouth to the soles of my feet. Then I start to shake uncontrollably, with the shakes progressing into worse tremors in my left thigh and right biceps. The shaking definitely seems to start from the abdomen or groin area. If I press my thighs or groin or even touch them lightly, my legs increase in spasticity. When these episodes end, I feel completely wiped out (blurry vision and hard, tired muscles), but I never return to normal. I always feel shaky and not myself. I have been at the doctor's twice when these episodes were happening. The first time my bp was a bit high at 130 mmhg (usually I am spot on at 120/80 mmhg) and the other time my vitals did not change at all during the episode. Other information, possibly related: my left thigh and knee are filled with fluid, but my orthopedist attributes that to a popliteal cyst (is that the same as an aneurysm?) he found behind my knee. He gave me a cortisone injection four days ago, but so far the swelling in the front of my thigh, my knee, and my calf have not gone down. I was also told that I have an umbilical hernia and two inguinal hernias. I also have a history of localized scleroderma, which I understand, can weaken the connective tissues and blood vessels. Recent blood tests for ana and rheumatoid factor both came back negative. Not sure how that is possible when I was diagnosed with a positive ana and localized scleroderma (morphea) 25 years ago. I am very scared. Do you have any idea of what is happening to me? or what tests I should have done? not sure if this is gi related, vascular, rheumatology, etc. But I need to find a way to calm these spells so I can go back to work.."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello. The symptoms do sound a bit different and something we need to look into. As per the issues, I hope they have looked into any form of venous obstruction i.e. Super vein obstruction. Any compression on that vein can cause the face to turn red and a bit of low blood pressure. But it is a very rare thing to happen. A CT (computed tomography) of the chest would be advisable to rule out this compression causing the symptoms. But yes, it does not explain what is happening in your legs. The symptoms do see to be of hypersensitivity. Do these symptoms happen after a hot water bath as well? do you feel any shock-like sensation from the neck below? For the popliteal cyst, it is a bakers cyst. It is totally different from aneurysm, as aneurysm will be pulsating and moreover it is a very unusual site for it to happen. Normally, it does respond to injection cortisone, but sometimes if the injection does not go in the right place it can persist. You may need to repeat the injection after a month or so incase it is persisting. As for localized scleroderma, it is a benign form and ana can go negative at times. We can either call it a lab error or at times the body does act through to make it negative. How much has been the skin extent in your scleroderma though?  to summarize, we need to figure out a cause for your symptoms. Scleroderma does not explain it. We need to see if it is an svc (superior vena cava) obstruction. Of the rarest cause, with the spasticity happening in your legs on touching I would like to rule out any brain condition as well. These sound like paroxysmal dyskinesia. I hope this helps."}]}

As for the feeling of cold water going down your thirst and the acid reflux, both indicate an inflammatory condition esophagitis and gastritis. This can be treated with a proton pump inhibitor controloc (pantoprazole) once daily and an antacid ranitidine before every meal. The bad breath could be due to inflamed gums or an infection such as H.pylori. So I recommend you get a test for H.pylori infection and consult a dentist to examine your gums. Bad breath can also be due to sinusitis. Sinusitis can also be the cause of the post nasal discharge (phelgm at the back of your throat) and can be treated with an anti-inflammatory ibuprofen twice daily and an antihistaminic as cetirizine or zyrtec once daily before going to bed for 10 days."}]}

Thyroid hormone is normally very important for many functions of the body. It helps in the early development of the fetus. The brain is one of the parts of early organ development. In early pregnancy, fetus mainly depends on mother's thyroid level because fetus itself cannot produce up to around 11 to 12 weeks (three months). There is no data available whether you have taken treatment early and adequately. But yes, there is data that hypothyroidism can affect brain development and function in baby permanently and whatever damage occurs is irreversible.
