Maxillary and ethmoid sinuses are large enough to harbor infections from infancy. Frontal sinuses are rarely large enough to harbor infections until the sixth to tenth year of life. Sphenoid sinuses do not become large until about the third to fifth year of life. In general, a 'cold' lasting longer than 10 to 14 days with fever and facial pain is suggestive of rhinosinusitis. Examination of the nose can reveal pus draining from the middle meatus in maxillary, frontal, or anterior ethmoid sinusitis. Pus in the superior meatus indicates sphenoid or posterior ethmoid sinuses. Diagnosis is on clinical grounds and can be difficult. Positive findings on plain sinus films in a symptomatic child are supportive of sinusitis. CT scans are more sensitive, but are usually reserved for the more complicated cases. The treatment is usually oral antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. Decongestants and antihistamines have not been shown to be helpful or necessary.Brain abscess is unlikely in this patient who demonstrates no neurologic symptoms. A streptococcal throat infection should present with acute onset of sore throat without other signs and symptoms of upper respiratory infection. Sphenoid sinusitis usually does not cause facial pain or drainage from the middle meatus. The child might have a middle-ear infection coincident with a sinusitis, but her lack of ear pain suggests otherwise."}]}

Approximately 60% of Meckel's diverticula contain heterotopic mucosa, of which more than 60% consists of gastric mucosa. Second most common ectopic mucosa is that of Pancreas (Pancreatic acini). Other mucosa are ­colonic mucosa, Brunner's gland, pancreatic islets, endometriosis and hepatobiliary tissue. A useful but crude Mnemonic used traditionally for describing Meckel's diverticula is.

Bleeding. bleeding in Meckel's diverticulum is usually the result of ulceration in ileal mucosa adjacent to the diverticulum caused by the acid secreted by heterotopic gastric mucosa within the diverticulum.. Intestinal obstruction Intestinal obstruction associated with Meckel's diverticulum can result from several mechanisms.. Volvulus of the intestine around the fibrous band attaching the diverticulum to the umbilicus Intussusception with the diverticulum acting as the lead point. Entrapment of intestine by a mesodiverticular band (Mesodiverticular band is a remnant of left vitelline artery, it tethers the Meckel's diverticulum to the ileal mesentry.) Stricture secondary to chronic diverticulitis.. Diverticulitis. clinical picture is similar to appendicitis. diverticulitis may lead to perforation. Littre's hernia - rarely Meckel's diverticulum is found in inguinal or femoral hernia. This is known as Littre's hernia..  Diagnostic studies. Meckel's diverticulum in the absence of bleeding can be rarely diagnosed before surgical intervention. Barium meal follow through can rarely demonstrate the diverticulum. Barium enteroclysis can demonstrate the diverticula in 75% of cases but is avoided during acute presentation of complication. If repeated episodes of lower GI bleed occur and an ectopic gastric mucosa in the Meckel's diverticulum is suspected, it can be demonstrated by Technetium99 pertechnate radionuclide scan.

Distinctive Pathophvsiological features include: Heterogeneous hyperophy of LV Pattern of hyperophy is distinctive Asymmetrical septa! hyperophy is characteristic mainly affecting the IV septum and anterolateral wall Thickness of ventricular septum is dispropoionately increased when compared with the free wall Dynamic LV outflow obstruction The LV outflow obstruction is dynamic i.e. it is related to narrowing of the subaoic area as a consequence of opposition of anterior mitral valve leaflet against the hyperophied septum in midsystole. The concept is termed systolic anterior motion (SAM) of mitral valve. The obstruction in HOCM is dynamic and is caused by the opposition of mitral valve leaflet against the hyperophied septum during systole. Increase in volume of blood in LV will move the muscular obstruction away from the opposite wall and decrease the obstructing agent as well as the intensity of murmur. Passive leg raising augments venous return, increases the volume of blood in LV, decreases the obstruction and hence decreases the murmur. Increase in myocardial contractility worsens the obstruction by moving the opposing walls closer to each other. 13 agonists (increase myocardial contractility) would thus increase the obstruction and should not be used. 13 blockers on the other hand are the agent of choice as these decrease myocardial contractility and hence relieve the obstruction by moving the opposing walls away from each other.

Asa result of venous outflow obstruction, the liver becomes acutely congested, with the development of impaired liver function and, subsequently, portal hypertension, ascites and oesophagealvarices. In an acute thrombosis, the patient may rapidly progress to fulmi- nant liver failure but, in the majority of cases, abdominal discomfort and ascites are the main presenting features. If chronic, the liver progresses to established cirrhosis. The cause of the venous thrombosis needs to be established, and an underlying myeloproliferative disorder or pro-coagulant state is commonly found, such as anti-thrombin 3, protein C or protein S deficiency. The diagnosis is commonly suspected in a patient presenting with ascites, in whom a CT scan shows a large congested liver (early stage) or a small cirrhotic liver in which there is gross enlargement of segment I (the caudate lobe). This feature results from preservation and hypertrophy of the segment with direct venous drainage to the I VC in the face of atrophy of the rest of the liver due to venous obstruction. IVC compression or occlusion from the segment I hypertrophy is also a common feature, as is thrombosis of the portal vein. Confirmation of the suspected diagnosis is by hepatic venography via a transjugular approach, which demonstrates occlusion of the hepatic veins and may allow a transjugular biopsy."}]}

The child is expressing the symptoms of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, a premature aging disease, which is due to a mutation in the LMNA gene, which encodes lamin A, a nuclear protein. The most common mutation is C1824T, in which the normal cytosine at position 1,824 of the gene is replaced by a thymine. This is a silent mutation as far as the protein is concerned-G608G. However, the introduction of the T creates a cryptic splice site in the gene, such that as the hnRNA is processed, a lamin A mRNA is created that is missing 150 nucleotides, corresponding to a loss of 50 amino acids near the carboxy terminal of the protein. Under normal conditions, lamin A is farnesylated, which allows the protein to be attached to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. During processing, the enzyme AMPSTE24 cleaves part of the carboxy terminal, releasing the farnesylated portion of the protein such that lamin A can be transferred to the nucleus, where it is involved in providing a scaffold for the nuclear membrane. In the mutant protein (progerin), the site of cleavage is lost owing to the loss of the C-terminal amino acids, although the site of farnesylation still remains. Thus, the progerin that reaches the nucleus is still bound to the nuclear membrane, distorting the nuclear membrane and contributing to nuclear instability. Chromatin binding to the nuclear membrane is also altered, as are the phosphorylation sites in progerin, which makes it more difficult for the nuclear membrane to dissolve during mitosis. Because this is a silent mutation in the mature protein, the tertiary structure of the protein is not altered, and a premature stop codon has not been introduced into the protein (that would be a nonsense mutation, not a silent mutation). Since the protein amino acid sequence is initially the same, an alternative start site for transcription has not been created, nor does a simple base change lead to an inhibition of DNA replication."}]}

In this condition, the patient has eye blinking, facial movements, or throat clearing lasting for weeks to about a year. No medications are needed. Chronic motor tics persist throughout life and can incorporate motor movements involving up to three muscle groups.Gilles de la Tourette syndrome is a lifelong condition that is characterized by motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive behavior, and a high incidence of attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADDH). Therapy for the ADDH is helpful, as is medication to control the motor or vocal tics.

Some amino acids (isoleucine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) are both glucogenic and ketogenic because their degradation pathway forms multiple products.a. Amino acids that are converted to pyruvate (see Figure I).(1). The amino acids that are synthesized from the intermediates of glycolysis (serine, glycine, cysteine, and alanine) are degraded to form pyruvate.(a). Serine is converted to 2-phosphoglycerate, an intermediate of glycolysis, or directly to pyruvate and NH4+ by serine dehydratase, an enzyme that requires PLP.(b). Glycine, in a reversal of the reaction utilized for its synthesis, reacts with methylene-FH4 to form serine.1. Glycine also reacts with FH4 and NAD+ to produce CO2 and NH4+ (glycine cleavage enzyme).2. Glycine can be converted to glyoxylate, which can be oxidized to CO2 and H2 O or converted to oxalate.(c). Cysteine forms pyruvate. Its sulfur, which was derived from methionine, is converted to H2 SO4 , which is excreted by the kidneys.(d). Alanine can be transaminated to pyruvate.b. Amino acids that are converted to intermediates of the TCA cycle (see Figure II).(1). The carbons from the four groups of amino acids form the TCA cycle intermediates: a-ketoglutarate, succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and oxaloacetate.(a). Amino acids that form a-ketoglutarate (see Figure III).1. Glutamate can be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form a- ketoglutarate.2. Glutamine is converted by glutaminase to glutamate with the release of its amide nitrogen as NH4+ 3. Proline is oxidized so that its ring opens, forming glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.4. Arginine is cleaved by arginase in the liver to form urea and ornithine. Ornithine is transaminated to glutamate semialdehyde, which is oxidized to glutamate.5. Histidine is converted to formiminoglutamate (FIGLU). The formimino group is transferred to FH4, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate.(b). Amino acids that form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV)1. Four amino acids are converted to propionyl-CoA, which is carboxylated in a biotin requiring reaction to form methylmalonyl-CoA, which is rearranged to form succinyl-CoA in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 (seen previously in the metabolism of odd-chain number fatty acids).a). Threonine is converted by a dehydratase to NH4+ and a-ketobutyrate, which is oxidatively decarboxylated to propionyl-CoA.In a different set of reactions, threonine is converted to glycine and acetyl-CoA.b). Methionine provides methyl groups for the synthesis of various compounds; its sulfur is incorporated into cysteine; and the remaining carbons form succinyl-CoA.i. Methionine and ATP form S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which donates a methyl group and forms homocysteine.ii. Homocysteine is reconverted to methionine by accepting a methyl group from the FH4 pool via vitamin B12 .iii. Homocysteine can also react with serine to form cystathionine. The cleavage of cystathionine produces cysteine, NH4+ , and a-ketobutyrate, which is converted to propionyl-CoA.c). Valine and isoleucine, two of the three branched-chain amino acids, form succinyl-CoA (see Figure IV).i. The degradation of all the three branched-chain amino acids begins with a transamination followed by an oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (Figure V). This enzyme, like pyruvate dehydrogenase and a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, requires thiamine pyrophosphate, lipoic acid, CoA, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and NAD+.ii. Valine is eventually converted to succinyl-CoA via propionyl-CoA and methylmalonyl-CoA.iii. Isoleucine also forms succinyl-CoA after two of its carbons are released as acetyl-CoA.(c). Amino acids that form fumarate1. Three amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, and aspartate) are converted to fumarate (see Figure II).a). Phenylalanine is converted to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase in a reaction requiring tetrahydrobiopterin and O2 (Figure VI).b). Tyrosine, obtained from the diet or by hydroxylation of phenylalanine, is converted to homogentisic acid. The aromatic ring is opened and cleaved, forming fumarate and acetoacetate.c). Aspartate is converted to fumarate via reactions of the urea cycle and the purine nucleotide cycle.d). Aspartate reacts with IMP to form AMP and fumarate in the purine nucleotide cycle.(d). Amino acids that form oxaloacetate (see Figure II)1. Aspartate is transaminated to form oxaloacetate.2. Asparagine loses its amide nitrogen as NH4+ , forming aspartate in a reaction catalyzed by asparaginase.c. Amino acids that are converted to acetyl-CoA or acetoacetate (see Figure VI).(1). Four amino acids (lysine, threonine, isoleucine, and tryptophan) can form acetyl-CoA, and phenylalanine and tyrosine form acetoacetate. Leucine is degraded to form both acetyl-CoA and acetoacetate.In maple syrup urine disease, the a-keto acid dehydrogenase involved in metabolism of the branched-chain amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) is defective. McArdle disease is caused by a defective muscle glycogen phosphorylase, such that the muscle cannot generate glucose from glycogen, leading to exercise intolerance. Glycogen accumulates in the muscle because of this enzyme deficiency (McArdle disease is one of the glycogen storage disease). A defect in the synthesis or processing of collagen will lead to a variety of diseases, of which Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is one (osteogenesis imperfecta is another). Parkinson disease is caused by low levels of dopamine in the nervous system. In the initial stages of Parkinson disease, giving DOPA can reduce the severity of the symptoms because DOPA can be decarboxylated to form dopamine. DOPA can easily enter the brain, whereas dopamine cannot. Tay-Sachs disease results from an inability to degrade GM2, a ganglioside (it is also a sphingolipid). The enzyme missing is b-hexosaminidase.I. Amino acids derived from the intermediates of glycolysis. These amino acids can be synthesized from glucose and can be reconverted to glucose in the liver.II. The degradation of amino acids. A. Amino acids that produce pyruvate or the intermediates of the TCA cycle. These amino acids are considered glucogenic because their carbons can produce glucose in the liver. B. Amino acids that produce acetyl-CoA or ketone bodies. These amino acids are considered ketogenic. CoA, coenzyme A; HMG-CoA, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA; TCA, tricarboxylic acid.III.

Brilliantly translucent Cystic hygromas are fluid-filled sacs that result from a blockage in the lymphatic system and are lined by single layer of epithelium. Cystic hygromas are single or multiple cysts found mostly in the neck region. Swelling may be bilateral and is soft and paially compressible, visibly increasing in size when the child cough or cries. The characteristic that distinguishes it from all other swelling of the neck is that it is brilliantly translucent. A cystic hygroma can be present as a bih defect (congenital) or develop at any time life. A cystic hygroma in a developing baby can progress to hydrops (an excess amount of fluid in the body) and eventually fetal death. Some cases of congenital cystic hygromas resolve leading to webbed neck, edema (swelling), and a lymphangioma (a benign yellowish-tan tumor on the skin composed of swollen lymph vessels). In other instances the hygroma can progress in size to become larger than the fetus. Cystic hygromas occur in approximately 1% of fetuses between weeks 9 and 16 of pregnancy.

Chylomicrons are produced by enterocytes (intestinal epithelial cells), using gut luminal triglycerides for the source of the lipid. The chylomicrons are secreted into the gut lymphatic system, and from there drain eventually into the systemic venous system from the thoracic duct, and hence into the serum poion of the blood. They are initially large and have a very high triglyceride content. With time, lipoprotein lipase releases triglycerides from the chylomicron core by hydrolyzing them to more easily absorbed fatty acids. The enzyme is located on the external surface of the vascular endothelium of tissues with triglyceride needs such as skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle tissue, and lactating breast. The result of lipoprotein lipase activity is that the chylomicrons shrink in size. While adipose tissue can utilize chylomicrons, lipoprotein lipase is located on the endothelial cells rather than adipocytes. Adipocytes have an adipose tissue lipase, which is an intracellular enzyme that can cleave triglycerides to glycerol and fatty acids, allowing them to be released into the circulation when chylomicrons are low. Enterocytes have the ability to pick up mixed micelles from the gut lumen for repackaging in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum as chylomicrons. Hepatocytes pick up the chylomicron remnants after the lipoprotein lipase shrinks them."}]}

A competitive inhibitor could bind to an allosteric site of the free enzyme and prevent substrate binding, as long as it does not bind to the allosteric site when the substrate is bound. For example, strychnine acts as an allosteric inhibitor of the glycine receptor in the mammalian spinal cord and brain stem. Glycine is a major post-synaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter with a specific receptor site. Strychnine binds to an alternate site that reduces the affinity of the glycine receptor for glycine, resulting in convulsions due to lessened inhibition by the glycine.

Leukocytosis (increased numbers of leukocytes in the peripheral blood) is a reaction seen in many different diseasestates. The type of leukocyte that is mainly increased may be an indicator of the type of disease process present. Eosinophilia can be associated with cutaneous allergic reactions; allergic disorders, such as bronchial asthma or hay fever; Hodgkin's disease; some skin diseases, such as pemphigus, eczema, and dermatitis herpetiformis; and parasitic infections, such as trichinosis (caused by infection with trichinella spiralis), schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis. The most common cause of eosinophilia is probably allergy to drugs such as iodides, aspirin, or sulfonamides, but eosinophilia is also seen in collagen vascular diseases. Marked eosinophilia occurs in hypereosinophilic syndromes (Loffler's syndrome and idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome), which may be treated with coicosteroids. In contrast, neutrophilic leukocytosis (neutrophilia) may be the result of acute bacterial infections or tissue necrosis, such as is present with myocardial infarction, trauma, or burns. Basophilia is most commonly seen in immediate type (type I) hypersensitivity reactions. Both eosinophils and basophils may be increased in patients with any of the chronic myeloproliferative syndromes. Monocytosis is seen in chronic infections, such as tuberculosis, some collagen vascular diseases, neutropenic states, and some types of lymphomas. Lymphocytosis (especially with increased numbers of I lymphocytes) may be seen along with monocytosis in chronic inflammatory states or in acute viral infections, such as viral hepatitis or infectious mononucleosis."}]}

Telomerase reactivation After a fixed number of divisions, normal cells becomes arrested in a terminally nondividing state. How does the normal cells count their divisions i.e. How, do the cells find out that now the), do'nt need to divide fuher. Cells achieve this through telomer shoening Telomers are sho repeated sequences of DNA present at the linear ends of chromosome that are impoant for ensuring complete replication of chromosome ends. It consists of many arrays of TTAGGG repeats at terminal of 3' ending strand. It confers stability to chromosomes. With each successive division there is some shoening of the telomers. Once the telomers are shoened beyond a ceain point the ends of the chromosome are seen as broken DNA, which signals cell cycle arrest. The broken DNA leads to activation of p53 dependent cell cycle check points causing proliferative arrest or apoptosis. Thus telomere shoening functions as a clock that counts cell division. How do the germ cells keep on dividing throughout their life ??? In germ cells telomere shoening is prevented by the sustained function of the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase and is responsible for telomer synthesis and maintaining the length of telomer. It is RNA dependent DNA polymerase. It has one segment that is complimentary to TTAGGG repeat and is used as template for the replication of telomeric sequence. This enzyme is absent from most somatic cells and hence they suffer progressive loss of telomers and they exit the cell cycle. Telomerase is present in Germ cells thus explaining the ability of these cells to self replicate extensively. If loss of telomere is the basis of finite life span then how do cancer cells continue to divide actively ???? In cancer cells telomerase activity is reactivated. Telomerase activity has been detected in more than 90% of human tumours. Thus telomerase activity and maintenance of telomere length are essential for the replicative potential in cancer cells."}]}

Thiamine (vitamin B1) is conveed intracellularly to its active form, thiamine pyrophosphate, which is an essential cofactor in intermediate carbohydrate metabolism. Thiamine acts as a coenzyme for enzymes involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which plays a critical role in the production of energy from food, and the pentose-phosphate pathway, which produces an impoant intermediate, ribose-5-phosphate, required for the synthesis of ATP, GTP, DNA, RNA, and NADPH. The brain is paicularly vulnerable to thiamine deficiency because it relies exclusively on carbohydrates for immediate energy demands. The selective vulnerability of ceain structures accounts for the specific clinical manifestations of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP), the physiologically active form of thiamine, is required for the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH catalyzes oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA, regulating entry into the citric acid cycle for metabolites leaving glycolysis. The PDH complex is comprised of 3 separate enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase (decarboxylase), dihydrolipoamide transacetylase and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Besides TPP, the complex also requires CoA, NAD, FAD, and lipoic acid as coenzymes. The mechanism of TPP action includes formation of a carbanion that can attack the electron-deficient keto carbon of pyruvate. In addition, TPP functions as a coenzyme for alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and transketolase. Pyridoxal phosphate serves as a coenzyme for glycogen phosphorylase. Vitamin B12 acts as a cofactor of L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which catalyzes conversion of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Methionine synthase activation leads to synthesis of methionine from homocysteine with folic acid as a coenzyme."}]}

Reducing end plate potential Curare (D-tubocurarine) is a competitive neuromuscular blocker. All neuromuscular blockers bind to Nm receptors on end-plate and prevents generation of end-plate potential. Mechanism of action of muscle relaxants To know the mechanism of action of different skeletal muscle relaxants one should know the normal sequences of events in contraction and relaxation of skeletal muscle ? A. Contraction There is discharge of motor neuron. Release of Ach at neuromuscular junction. Binding of Ach to nicotinic (NM) cholinergic receptors at end plate. Binding of Ach to nicotinic receptors causes opening of Na. channels (NM receptor has intrinsic ion channel). Opening of Na+channel generate end plate potential on skeletal muscle membrane. If end plate potential is above a threshold level, action potential is generated on skeletal muscle membrane- depolarization. Depolarization of skeletal muscle membrane causes intracellular release of Ca\" from sarcoplasmic reticulum. Ca\" binds to troponin 'c', uncovering myosin binding site of actin. Cross linking between actin and myosin, and sliding of thin filaments on thick filaments - contraction. B. Relaxation Ca\" pumped back into sarcoplasmic reticulum. Release of Ca\" from Troponin. Cessation of interaction between actin and myosin - relaxation. Now coming back to the mechanism of different skeletal muscle relaxants. Competitive (nondepolarising) blockers The competitive blockers have affinity for N. receptors but no intrinsic activity. They compete with Ach for N receptor --) called competitive blockers. They prevent binding of Ach to N. receptors- No opening of Na- channels - No depolarization, so these are called non-depolarizing blockers. Competitive blockers reduce the frequency of channel opening but not its duration or the conductance of a channel once it has opened. When the magnitude of end plate potential falls below a critical level, it is unable to trigger propagated muscle action potential muscle fails to contract. Neostigmine (anticholinesterases) antagonises competitive blockers. Depolarizing blockers Depolarizing blockers have affinity as well as submaximal intrinsic activity on A r receptors. They depolarize muscle end plates by opening of Na+ channels and initially produce twitching and fasciculations (not full contraction as these drugs have submaximal activity)-o, they are called depolarizing blocker. These drugs do not dissociate rapidly from the receptor (NM) - Persistant paial depolarization- Na+ channels get inactivated - flaccid paralysis. Neostigmine does not antagonise depolarising blockers. Under ceain conditions depolarizing agents produce dual mechanism of neuromuscular blockade which can be divided into two phases : a. Phase I block Rapid in onset Result from persistant depolarization of muscle end plate. Has classical features of depolarization block. Block is not antogonized by anticholinesterases (neostigmine). b. Phase H block Slow in onset Results from desensitization of receptor to ACh. Resembles block produced by competitive blockers. Block is paially reversed by anticholinesterases (Neostigmine). In man normally only phase I block is seen typical depolarizing block. Phase II block is seen when fluorinated anaesthetics have been given or when SCh is injected in high dose.

There are four types of epiphysis:a. Pressure epiphysis: The region of the long bone that forms the joint is a pressure epiphysis (e.g. the head of the femur, head of the humerus, condyles of femur and tibia). Pressure epiphyses assist in transmitting the weight of the human body and are the regions of the bone that are under pressure during movement or locomotion.b. Traction epiphysis: The regions of the long bone which are non-articular, i.e. not involved in joint formation. Unlike pressure epiphyses, these regions do not assist in weight transmission. However, their proximity to the pressure epiphysis region means that the supporting ligaments and tendons attach to these areas of the bone. Examples of traction epiphyses are tubercles of the humerus (greater tubercle and lesser tubercle), and trochanters of the femur (greater and lesser).c.

In Wilson disease, main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. Liver disease may present as tiredness, increased bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and portal hypertension. On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider naevi (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most patients by the time they develop symptoms. About 5% of all patients are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure, often in the context of a hemolytic anemia. About half the patients with Wilson's have neurological or psychiatric problems. Specific neurological symptoms then follow, often in the form of parkinsonism (increased rigidity and slowing of routine movements) with or without a typical hand tremor, masked facial expressions, slurred speech, ataxia (lack of coordination) or dystonia (twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body).Various medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in Wilson's disease, where Kayser-Fleischer rings (KF rings) may be visible around the iris. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane of the cornea. They do not occur in all patients and may only be visible on slit lamp examination. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts, brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Kidneys: renal tubular acidosis, a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the PCT leads to nephrocalcinosis (calcium accumulation in the kidneys), weakening of the bone (due to calcium and phosphate loss) and occasionally aminoaciduria.

Associated symptoms such as hearing loss and vertigo are thought to occur as a result of transmission of the virus via direct proximity of cranial nerve (CN) VIII to CN VII at the cerebellopontine angle or via vasa vasorum that travel from CN VII to other nearby cranial nerves.> If diagnosis of Ramsay Hunt syndrome is not established by physical examination alone, consider a head CT scan to investigate other etiologies of facial paralysis.> Early administration (<72 h) of acyclovir showed an increased rate of facial nerve function recovery and prevented further nerve degeneration. Evidence is accumulating that VZV may be responsible for many cases of Bell palsy that go unrecognized because of a lack of cutaneous findings (zoster sine herpete).> Accordingly, the clinician should entertain more liberal use of antivirals such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir.

Anode The anode in an X-ray tube consists of a tungsten target embedded in a copper stem. The purpose of the target in an X-ray tube is to convert the kinetic energy of the colliding electrons into X-ray photons. The target is made of tungsten, an element that has several characteristics of an ideal target material, including the following:. High atomic number (74) High melting point (3422 C) High thermal conductivity (173 W. m-1. K-1) Low vapor pressure at the working temperature of an X-ray tube.. The focal spot is the area on the target to which the focusing cup directs the electrons and from which X-rays are produced. The sharpness of a radiographic image increases as the size of the focal spot decreases. However, the heat generated per unit target area becomes greater as the focal spot decreases in size. To take advantage of a small focal spot while distributing the electrons over a larger area of the target, the target is placed at an angle to the electron beam. The apparent size of the focal spot seen from a position perpendicular to the electron beam (the effective focal spot) is smaller than the actual focal spot size. Typically, the target is inclined about 20 degrees to the central ray of the X-ray beam; this causes the effective focal spot to be approximately 1 mm x 1 mm, as opposed to the actual focal spot, which is about 1 mm x 3 mm. This smaller effective focal spot results in a small apparent source of X-rays and an increase in the sharpness of the image, with a larger actual focal spot size to improve heat dissipation.

A) Congenital myogenic ptosis :- It is the most common type of ptosis and is often bilateral. It is associated with maldevelopment or congenital weakness of levator palpebrae sperioris. Congenital myogenic ptosis is characterized by drooping of one or both lids at bih, with a diminished or absent lid crease and lid lag on downgaze due to tethering effect of abnormal muscle. It may occur in following forms Simple congenital ptosis :- Not associated with other anomaly Congenital ptosis with superior rectus weakness Blepharophimosis syndrome Congenital ptosis, blepharophimosis, telecanthus and epicanthus inversus. Congenital synkinetic ptosis (Marcus Gunn jaw- winking Ptosis):- Retraction of ptotic lid with jaw movement like chewing, i.e., with stimulation of ipsilateral pterygoid muscle. B) Acquird ptosis :- Depending upon the cause acquired ptosis may be Neurogenic :- It is due to paralysis of 3rd nerve, Horner's syndrome, ophthalmoplegic migraine, multiple sclerosis. Neurogenic ptosis may also occur due to lesion of sympathetic nerve) supplying muller's muscle. Myogenic :- It is due to acquired defect of LPS muscle and may be seen in myasthenia gravis, dystrophia myotonica, ocular myopathy, oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy, thyrotoxicosis, Lambe - Eaton mysthenia syndrome Mechanical:- It is due to excessive weight on the upper lid e.g in lid tumors, multiple chalazia, lid edema. It may also occur due to scarring (cicatracial ptosis) in atients with ocular pemphigoid and trachoma. Aponeurotic ptosis :- It is due to defect of the levator aponeurosis in the presence of normal functioning muscle, e.g. involutional (senile) ptosis, post-operative ptosis."}]}

Most are found in patients younger than 20 years.> Osteochondromas are located adjacent to growth plates and they develop away from the growth plate with time because they are essentially isolated growth plates. They are affected by and respond to various growth factors and hormones in the same manner as epiphyseal growth plates, and the growth of the osteochondroma should cease at skeletal maturity.> Although they can be located almost anywhere in the skeleton, almost half of osteochondromas are found around the knee, in either the distal femur or the proximal tibia> Osteochondromas are most commonly diagnosed incidentally based on a radiograph obtained for some other reason. The second most common presenting symptom is a mass, which may or may not be associated with pain.> The pain is usually the result of mechanical symptoms that the osteochondroma causes by a direct mass effect on the overlying soft tissue. This can result in an associated sac or bursitis over the exostosis. Irritation of surrounding tendons, muscles, or nerves can result in pain.> Pain may also be due to fracture of a pedunculated ostoechondroma or malignant transformation."}]}

Of these all except HI, the remaining four form dimers to form a histone octamer. This histone octamer sits in the centre and that is surrounded by a segment of dsDNA of length approx. 146 bp (in a left handed supercoiling).

It leaves the pectoralis major muscle intact. The breast and associated structures are removed en bloc and the excised mass is composed of: - The whole breast - A large poion of skin, the centre of which overlies the tumour but which always include the nipple - All of the fat, fascia and lymph nodes of the axilla - The pectoralis minor muscle is either divided or retracted to gain access to the upper two-thirds of the axilla. The axillary vein and the nerves to serratus anterior and latissimus dorsi (the thoraco-dorsal trunk) should be preserved. Simple, sometimes called total, mastectomy has been the treatment of choice in the late 1980s and 1990s. Generally, only the breast is removed; though, sometimes, one or two lymph nodes may be removed as well. Two other surgical procedures are variations on the simple mastectomy. The skin-sparing mastectomy is a new surgical procedure in which the surgeon makes an incision, sometimes called a keyhole incision, around the areola. The tumor and all breast tissue are removed, but the incision is smaller and scarring is minimal. - The subcutaneous mastectomy, or nipple-sparing mastectomy, preserves the skin and the nipple over the breast. Paial mastectomy is used to remove the tumor, the lining over the chest muscle underneath the tumor, and a good poion of breast tissue, but not the entire breast. This is a good treatment choice for early stage cancers. Lumpectomy just removes the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding it. Some lymph nodes may be removed as well.

Cocaine when ingested results in hypehermia, hallucinations, euphoria and stimulation of libido Cocaine intoxication. With excessive or prolonged use, the drug can cause itching, tachcardia, hallucinations and paranoid delusions. Overdoses cause tachyarrythmias and a marked elevation of blood pressure, which can be life-threatening. Toxicity results in seizures, followed by respiratory and circulatory depression of medullar origin. This may lead to death from respiratory failure, stroke, or hea-failure. Cocaine is also highly pyrogenic, because the stimulation and increased muscular activity cause greater heat production. Heat loss is inhibited by the intense vasoconstriction. Cocaine-induced hypehermia may cause muscle cell destruction and myoglobinuria resulting in renal failure. Emergency treatment often consists of administering a benzodiazepine sedation agent, such as diazepam to decrease the elevated hea rate and blood pressure. Physical cooling (ice, cold blankets, etc.) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) may be used to treat hypehermia There is no officially approved specific antodote for cocaine overdose Cocaine's primary acute effect on brain chemistry is to raise the amount of dopamine and serotonin in the nucleus accumbens (the pleasure center in the brain); this effect ceases, due to metabolism of cocaine to inactive compounds and paicularly due to the depletion of the transmitter resources (tachyplaxis).

'a' i.e.. There is spike in action potentialo Na+ influx causes spike potential (i.e. phase of rapid depolarization in AP). Spike potential (phase of rapid depolarization of AP) is due to Na+ influx. Action potentials in nonautomatic fibers (Atria, ventricles) and in automatic fibers (S A node, AV node) have different ionic mechanisms for their generation. Action potential in nonautomatic fibers, i.e.. Cardiac muscles (atria, ventricles)o Normal RMPin myocardial fibers is about -90 mV. The AP in myocardial fibers has 5 phases : 0, 1,2, 3,4.Phase 0 : - It is the phase of rapid depolarization and is due to opening offast sodium channels.Phase 1 : - It is the initial phase of rapid repolarization. It is due to closure offast Na+ channels.Phase 2 : - This is plateu phaseQ. It is due to opening of'voltage gated slow Ca+ channelsQ. also called calcium- sodium channelsQ which causes calcium influxQ.Phase 3 : - This phase of final repolarization is due to opening of K+ channels. The membrane potential comes back to resting membrane potential.Phase 4 : - It is the resting phase, i.e., the phase of resting membrane potential.Action potential in automatic fibers fSA node and AY node)o The resting membrane potential of nodal fibers is less, i.e., about -65 mV (as compared to myocardium : -90 mV). Further, Resting membrane potential, even during resting phase (phase 4), moves steadily towards the depolarization, without any stimulus from nerves, hormones etc. When depolarization reaches a threshold level, an action potential is fired. Thus, between two action potentials (between the end of one action potentials and begining of other) there is slow and gradual depolarization which is called pacemaker potential or prepotential. The functional significance of the unsteady RMP is that nodal tissues generates rhythmic impulse \"spontaneously\"o Beside unsteady RMP (unsteady phase 4) other differences of nodal action potential from myocardial (atrial orventricular) AP are:- (i) Rapid repolarization and the platea (phase 1 and 2) are absent; and (ii) the late rapiddepolarization is slow.o Ionic basis of AP in S A and AV node are as follows : - The prepotential or pacemaker potentialQ (i.e., slow depolarization) starts due opening of funny (F) channelsQ which produce funny current. These channels are called funny channels because (i) Unlike most other channels, these are activated by hyperpolarization, and (ii) They can pass both Na+ and K+ (However, the dominant effect is that of Na\" influx). The later part of prepotential is due to opening of \"T\" type of calcium channelsQ (T stands for transient ) with calcium influx.When prepontial depolarizes the membrane upto threshold level, action potential develops. The action potential spike is largely due to opening of L type of calcium channels (L stands for long lasting) which causes Ca+2 influx.The repolarization is produced by opening of K+ channels which causes K+ efflux."}]}

Information about predisposing ancestry is conflicting, as are data concerning the assertion of a firstborn predilection. Metabolic alkalosis with low serum potassium and chloride levels is frequently seen in pyloric stenosis as a result of loss of gastric contents from vomiting. A child with a small-bowel obstruction (who may require an upper GI with small-bowel follow through to help diagnose the point of obstruction) should develop bilious emesis and should not look well 10 days into the illness; similarly, a child with intussusception (who requires an air contrast enema, which is both diagnostic and perhaps therapeutic) would be markedly ill at this point.

Injury and sepsis result in accelerated protein breakdown with increased urinary nitrogen loss and increased peripheral release of amino acids. The negative nitrogen balance represents the net result of breakdown and synthesis (with breakdown increased and synthesis increased or diminished). Amino acids such as alanine are released by muscle and transported to the liver for incorporation into acute-phase proteins including fibrinogen, complement, haptoglobin, and ferritin. The amino acids also undergo gluconeogenesis to glucose, which is utilized primarily by the brain and other glycolytic tissues such as peripheral nerves, erythrocytes, and bone marrow. Other tissues receive energy from fat in the form of fatty acids or ketone bodies during starvation following major trauma; this helps to conserve body protein. Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid in the blood, and its levels in muscle and blood decrease following injury and sepsis as it is consumed rapidly by replicating fibroblasts, lymphocytes, and intestinal endothelial cells. The use of glutamine may decrease protein catabolism in the intestine and may help prevent atrophy of the gastrointestinal tract in starved and parenterally nourished patients. Along with the counterregulatory hormones (glucagon, epinephrine, cortisol), interleukin 1 appears to mediate muscle breakdown. Recent studies have indicated that TNF (also called cachectin because of the role it plays in muscle wasting in septic or oncologic patients) also may be a principal catabolic cytokine in the traumatized patient. This protein is secreted by macrophages and further affects metabolism by inducing secretion of interleukin 1 and inhibiting synthesis and activity of lipogenic enzymes."}]}

Hangman's fracture (38%) are 2nd most common type of axis (C-2) fracture, only proceeded by odontoid fractures (41%) in incidence. It is 2nd only to occipito atlantal dislocations in cervical injuries leading to fatalities. Although fractures of axis accounts for 25 - 71% of deaths at the scene of injury, acute post admission moality is thought to be as low as 2 - 3%. Because of the high ratio of spinal canal size to spinal cord size at this level, neurological damage associated with hangman's fracture should be unusual (3- 10%). It is not necessary to treat this injury surgically as union always occursQ even in the displaced flexed position."}]}

Marfan's syndrome is a disorder of connective tissue (elastin). The gene called fibrillin is on chromosome 15. Inheritance is autosomal ominant. Sporadic cases may occur. The patients are tall and slender. Extremities especially the fingers and toes are long and thin. The muscles are markedly hypotonic and joints are hyperextendible. At times the disorder may be associated with arthrogryposis (contraction of joints in flexion due to fibrous ankylosis). There may be subluxation of the lens and other ocular abnormalities e.g., cataract, coloboma, squint, nystagmus and megalocornea. Deformities of the chest and spine may be present. Other associated anomalies include aortic cystic medionecrosis leading to aortic dilatation and other valvular deformities. Intelligence is normal. It should be distinguished from cases of homocystinuria, which also may present with ectopia lentis and similar bone changes, but has associated mental retardation. The basic manifestations are joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, dystrophic scarring of the skin and easy bruising, and connective tissue fragility. Wound healing is delayed and there are freely movable subcutaneous nodules. Molecular genetics has helped to characterize 11 different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Homocystinuria is a relatively common metabolic error with autosomal recessive inheritance. In the most common situation, Type 1, cystathionine is not synthesized from homocysteine and serine because the enzyme cystathionine synthetase in the liver is deficient. Although the precursor, homocysteine accumulates in the tissues, it is rapidly oxidized to homocystine. The usual age of presentation is 3-4 years. The patients develop subluxation of the lens, recurrent thromboembolic episodes and have marfanoid features. Klinefelter syndrome is characterized by tall thin stature, small testes and small phallus, with the chromosomal karyotype of 47 XXY. Behavioral and psychiatric disorders and mental retardation are common."}]}

Vincristine and the other vinca alkaloids bind to tubulin and impair microtubular assembly, preventing mitosis (M-phase-specific). Mechlorethamine, like cyclophosphamide (and carmustine and several others), is an alkylating agent. They are called bifunctional alkylating agents because they can covalently bind to DNA in two places ('nucleophilic attack'), thereby forming cross-links between two adjacent strands or between two bases in one strand. This ultimately disrupts DNA and RNA synthesis or may cause strand breakage. Cyclophosphamide (which can be considered the prototype of the alkylating agents) is actually a pro- drug--it requires metabolic activation in order for its effects to occur. Cyclophosphamide (and other alkylating agents) are cell cycle-nonspecific, although their efficacy is greater when cells are not in G0.Bleomycin, dactinomycin, and doxorubicin are good examples of drugs that intercalate in DNA strands. Thus, the altered DNA no longer serves as an adequately precise template for eventual synthesis of more functional DNA and RNA. They are classified as antitumor antibiotics. Etoposide and topotecan are examples of drugs that inhibit topoisomerase 11. The consequence is inhibited ability of affected cells to repair DNA strand breaks. This stops the cell cycle in G2 - The taxoid (e.g., paclitaxel) impairs mitosis, but by stabilizing assembled microtubules rather than by exeing a vinca alkaloid-like inhibition of microtubular assembly."}]}

Orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are RNA viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA genome. The influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviruses. They cause acute respiratory tract infections that usually occur in epidemics. Isolated strains of influenza virus are named after the virus type (influenza A, B, or C) as well as the host and location of initial isolation, the year of isolation, and the antigenic designation of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. Both the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase are glycoproteins under separate genetic control, and because of this they can and do vary independently. The changes in these antigens are responsible for the antigenic drift characteristic of these viruses. The paramyxoviruses include several important human pathogens (mumps virus, measles virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza virus). Both paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses possess an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is a structural component of the virion and produces the initial RNA. Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) are not related to the paramyxoviruses. They are 150-nm single-stranded RNA viruses. There are 2 antigen groups, A and B, which play no role in diagnosis and treatment. While the overall mortality is 0.5%, at-risk groups may be 25 to 35% mortality if untreated. Some parainfluenza virus infections (type 3) may be indistinguishable from RSV, but most parainfluenza infections produce a laryngotracheobronchitis known as croup."}]}

Case control study Recall bias is associated with Case-control studies. Park writes- \"When cases and controls are asked questions about their past history, it may be more likely for the cases to recall the existence of ceain events or factors than the controls who are healthy persons. For example, those who have had a myocardial infarction might be more likely to remember and recall ceain habits or events than those who have not. Thus cases may have a different recall of past events than controls. Recall bias is an error due to the differences in accuracy or completeness of recall to memory of past events or experiences. As a hypothetical example, suppose one is studying the possible relationship of congenital malformations to prenatal infections. A case-control study is conducted and interview is done of mothers of children with congenital malformations (cases) and mothers of children without malformations (controls). Each mother is questioned about infections she may have had during the pregnancy. A mother who has had a child with a bih defect tries to identify some unusual event that occurred during her pregnancy with that child. She wants to know whether the abnormality was caused by something she did. Why did it happen? Such a mother may even recall an event, such as a mild respiratory infection, that a mother of a child without a bih defect may not even notice or may have forgotten completely. This type of bias is known as recall bias. Bias is said to have occurred when there is a systematic difference between the results from a study and the true state of affairs. Bias may be introduced at all stages of the research process, from study design, through to analysis and publication. Bias can create a spurious association (i.e. overestimation of an effect) or mask a real one (underestimation of an effect). While appropriate statistical methods can reduce the effect of bias, they may not be able to eliminate it entirely. Innumerable number of bias have been listed. Bias associated with coho study: Selection Confounding Interviewer's bias Bias associated with Case-control study: Selection Confounding Recall bias Berkesonian bias Interviewer's bias Interviewer bias is a type of information bias that arises when an interviewer consciously or unconsciously elicits inaccurate information from study subjects. Interviewer bias can result in differential error, which can seriously disto disease-exposure associations, if the interviewer is aware of the disease status and exposure hypothesis in a case-control study, or if the interviewer is aware of the exposure status and outcome hypothesis in a coho study. In the former case, the interviewer may probe more deeply for evidence of exposure among cases than among controls. In the latter case, the interviewer may try to elicit evidence of health effects more assiduously in exposed than in unexposed coho members. Selection bias occurs when patients included in the study are not representative of the population to which the results will be applied. Confounding bias occurs when we find a spurious association between a potential risk factor and a disease outcome or miss a real association between them because we have failed to adjust for any confounding variables. A confounding variable or confounder is an exposure variable that is related to both the outcome variable (e.g. disease) and to one or more of the other exposure variables. For example in the study of the role of alcohol in the etiology of esophageal cancer, smoking is the confounding factor because it is associated with the consumption of alcohol and it is also an independent risk factor for esophageal cancer. Thus the effects of alcohol consumption on esophageal cancer can only be determined when the influence of smoking is neutralized by matching. Berkesonian bias: It occurs when patient admission rates vary between the experimental and control groups, especially in studies that use hospitalized patients for both groups. For example, this type of bias is present when hospitalized patients with the risk factor (experimental group) are admitted at a higher rate than the control group."}]}

Hydroceles are typically translucent and it is possible to 'get above the swelling' on examination of the scrotum.Hydrocele* A hydrocele is an abnormal collection of serious fluid in a part of the processus vaginalis, usually the tunica. Hydrocele fluid contains albumin and fibrinogen. If the contents of a hydrocele are allowed to drain into a collecting vessel, the liquid does not clot; however, the fluid coagulates if mixed with even a trace of blood that has been in contact with damaged tissue. About 5% of inguinal hernias are associated with a vaginal hydrocele on the same side. In congenital hydrocele, the processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Pressure on the hydrocele does not always empty it but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down; thus, the hydrocele is often intermittent. Encysted hydrocele of the cord is a smooth oval swelling near the spermatic cord, which is liable to be mistaken for an inguinal hernia. The swelling moves downwards and becomes less mobile if the testis is pulled gently downwards. Hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is a similar condition in females. The cyst lies in relation to the round ligament and is always at least partially within the inguinal canal."}]}

A classic feature of CD is the sharp demarcation of diseased bowel segments from adjucent uninvolved bowel. When multiple bowel segments are involved, the intervening bowel is normal to skip lesions. There is serpentine linear ulcer along the axis of the bowel. As the intervening mucosa tends to be relatively spared, the mucosa acquires a coarsely textured → Cobblestone appearance. Narrow fissures develop between the folds of the mucosa. Fissures can penetrate deeply through the bowel wall and leading to bowel adhesions and serositis. Further extension of fissures leads to fistula or sinus tract formation. There is transmural inflammation affecting all layers of the bowel wall. Sarcoid-like noncaseating granulomas may be present in all tissue layers. Neutrophilic infiltration into the crypts results in the formation of crypt abscess.

The retinal pigment epithelium also degenerates. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of this substance can damage the cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result, people with this disorder often lose their central vision and may experience blurry or distoed vision, and loss is rarely symmetric. Scotomata appear, first with red light and then for green; finally, relative (or in more serious cases, absolute) scotomata occur with white light.

Tissues contain characteristic isozymes or mixtures of isozymes. Enzymes, such as lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase (CK), differ from one tissue to another. Lactate dehydrogenase contains four subunits. Each subunit may be either of the heart (H) or the muscle (M) type. Five isozymes exist (HHHH, HHHM, HHMM, HMMM, and MMMM). CK contains two subunits. Each subunit may be either of the muscle (M) or the brain (B) type. Three isozymes exist (MM, MB, and BB). The MB fraction is most prevalent in heart muscle.Troponin I is found in large amounts in muscle cells. When a tissue is damaged, cellular enzymes leak into the blood. Heart muscle will release cardiac troponin I into the blood in response to a heart attack. In the absence of insulin, a person with type 1 DM will behave metabolically like a person undergoing prolonged starvation, except that blood glucose levels will be elevated. Lipolysis in adipose tissue will produce fatty acids, which will be converted to ketone bodies in the liver if the diabetes is left untreated. Because the blood glucose levels are also elevated, the brain continues to use glucose as a fuel, and the ketone bodies accumulate in the blood. Hepatitis and chronic alcoholism damage the liver, which would interfere with the urea cycle, leading to decreased BUN and increased ammonia in the circulation. Renal failure would display reduced creatinine in the urine and elevated creatinine in the blood."}]}

Oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) share a similar function with Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system-synthesis of myelin. Oli­godendrocytes are small, round, lymphocyte-size cells that produce and maintain CNS myelin, which is primarily located in the white matter. Certain diseases, such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, caused by a papovavirus, specifically attack oligoden­drocytes and produce demyelination. Oligodendrogli­omas are malignant tumors that are derived from oligo­dendrocytes. However, unlike Schwann cells, oligodendrocytes contribute segments of myelin sheaths to more than one axon. Gemistocytes are reactive astrocytes that have an eosinophilic cytoplasm. They are commonly seen along the periphery of cerebral infarctions. Some astro­cytomas have a gemistocytic appearance. Astrocytes provide the structural framework for the neurons and are analogous to the fibroblasts in connec­tive tissue. However, scarring in the brain is not associ­ated with collagen synthesis but with filling in the defect with the cellular processes of astrocytes. A cere­bral abscess is the only example of CNS repair with collagen, which is derived from the blood vessels. Microglial cells are derived from monocytes. They are the phagocytic cell of the CNS. Ependymal cells line the ventricles of the brain and the spinal canal. They do not produce CSF nor are they responsible for reabsorption of CSF, a function relegated to arachnoid cells."}]}

Sudden, painless monocular blindness is a sign of carotid disease. The symptom is also called amaurosis fugax . The patient may describe a shade dropping in front of the eye or describe vision like looking through ground glass. If a thrombus propagates up the carotid to the middle cerebral artery, then symptoms seen in middle cerebral artery occlusion or embolization (hemiparesis with sensory symptoms, aphasia depending on hemispheric dominance) will also occur. Midbasilar artery disease produces weakness and sensory loss with diplopia, loss of facial sensation or movement, and ataxia. Branches of the basilar artery supply the base of the pons and superior cerebellum. The symptoms described suggest disease in the posterior circulation, whichincludes paired veebral arteries, the basilar artery, and the paired posterior cerebral arteries. The basilar artery divides into two posterior cerebral arteries that provide branches to the cerebellum, medulla, pons, midbrain, thalamus, and temporal and occipital lobes. A midbasilar artery occlusion could cause ataxia of limbs by involving pontine nuclei; paralysis of the face, arm, and leg by involving coicospinal tracts; and impairment of facial sensation by involvement of fifth nerve nucleus. Occlusion of the entire middle cerebral artery results in contralateral hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, and homonymous hemianopsia. When the dominant hemisphere is involved, aphasia is present. When the nondominant hemisphere is involved, apraxia and neglect are produced. When only a penetrating branch of the middle cerebral artery is affected, the syndrome of pure motor hemiplegia is produced, as the infarct involves only the posterior limb of the internal capsule, involving only motor fibers to the face, arm, and leg (lacunar infarct)."}]}
