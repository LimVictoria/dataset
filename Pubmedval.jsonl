nar ( dromedary female    bactrian male ) and kez - nar ( bactrian female    dromedary male ) followed by f1 backcrossing with either dromedary for increased milk productivity or bactrian camel for wool and cold resistance ( faye and konuspayeva 2012 ) .\nf2 hybrids ( f1    f1 ) in old world camels are usually not favoured because of a difficult character and weak progeny performance ( faye and konuspayeva 2012 ) . in western regions of turkey ,\na relished sport is camel wrestling , where prized male tulus compete against each other in heavily regulated fights ( vedat 2010 ) . in this study\n, we developed diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) to identify f1 hybrids between dromedary and bactrian camels and their backcrosses .\nthese markers will facilitate the validation of non - invasive or historic samples with unclear or otherwise cryptic ancestry . as part of an on - going research project\n, we sequenced the genomes of 25 old world camelids [ c. dromedarius ( n  =  9 ) , c. ferus ( n  =  9 ) , c. bactrianus ( n  =  7 ) ] and aligned them to the c. ferus cb1 genome assembly ( genbank i d : gca_000311805.2 ) . to verify their species identity\n, these source individuals had previously been genotyped at 18 nuclear microsatellite loci and sanger sequenced for 800  bp of mitochondrial dna ( unpublished data ) .\n( 2013 ) and selected polymorphisms that were fixed for different alleles between c. dromedarius and both bactrian camel species , c. bactrianus and c. ferus ( see  supplementary methods in online resource 1 ) .\nwe tested the 26 candidate loci using pcr and sanger sequencing ( see  supplementary methods in online resource 1 ) on a panel of control individuals including three bactrian camels , three dromedaries , two hybrids ( f1 and f1 backcross ) and a two - humped individual with uncertain genetic background .\nall 26 candidate loci produced pcr products of the expected sizes , but we selected for sequencing only those 12 loci which produced single strong bands over consistent conditions ( table  1 ) . upon sequencing , all 12 loci were diagnostic between dromedaries and bactrian camels ( table  2 ) .\nhowever , in the f1 hybrid ( hyb56 ) only 10 ( 83.3  % ) of the diagnostic loci were heterozygous and the remaining two loci were homozygous for the bactrian allele ( table  2 ) .\nthis suggests that at these two loci ( hp264 and hp288 ) the bactrian allele may be present at low frequency in dromedaries as a result of being a shared ancestral polymorphism ( not diagnostic ) or from historical hybridization between the two species .\nthe f1 backcross ( hyb55 ) was heterozygous for two ( 16.7  % ) of the diagnostic loci and homozygous for the bactrian allele in the remaining loci .\nin the two - humped individual with uncertain origin ( dc575 ) , four ( 33.3  % ) of the diagnostic loci were heterozygous , demonstrating hybrid ancestry in this animal ( table  2 ) . \n\ntable  1primer sequences and information for the 12 diagnostic locilocusprimer sequence ( 53 ) \n scaffold \n position \n allelest \n lengthhp206tgtcagactgttaggcattgc catccaagtctccatctaacccnw_006210212.1501206c / g57125hp379aggatgccatcatgtcagg gagggagctctcatgaataggnw_006210464.11151379g / a58150hp405ccaggagcttttcgagtagc cagcacagagaactcactgcnw_006211106.15030405g / c59125hp429gcaggcatacaaactaaccc gcttttctttctggctcaggnw_006210666.12288429a / c57125hp458tgtgaccagacagaccaagg tgtggcttagggtctttatggnw_006210457.111458t / c58140hp501gaatagattggggagcaagc ctcttctccatccctatggcnw_006211169.1218501a / t59125hp597atgaacagtttgggtttggg cgcgatgtcacctttataggnw_006211126.16065597a / c59125hp633gcatgtagaaggtttgcatagg cagcctttcttgcatctggnw_006210489.14279633g / c57125hp900ccacatgctcaggtatctgg gggattccttgtgctacagcnw_006211075.1294900g / c59125hp930ctcccaggaaacaaaagtcc tttgggagtgttctgtctgcnw_006210745.13459930c / a59125hp264tggacagaaactttgtgtctcc tttggtaagggcatgaatccnw_006211022.1519264t / c59125hp288gtctatgagggcgtttctgc cagccttcttgttctgttcgnw_006211252.1214288t / a59125see online resource 2 for additional details on these and the remaining 14 primers examinedtm : primer annealing temperaturelength : pcr product length \n left ( forward ) primer given above the right ( reverse ) primer \n accession number from genbank and position of the snp in the scaffoldtable  2sanger genotypes for the 12 loci sequencedsample idspecieslocationhp206 ( g|c)hp379 ( a|g)hp405 ( c|g)hp429 ( c|a)hp458 ( c|t)hp501 ( t|a)hp597 ( c|a)hp633 ( c|g)hp900 ( c|g)hp930 ( a|c)hp264 ( c|t)hp288 ( a|t)drom155 \n c. dromedarius \n australiaggaaccccccttccccccaaccaadrom214 \n c. dromedarius \n syriaggaaccccccttccccccaaccaadrom814 \n c. dromedarius \n sudanggaaccccccttccccccaaccaadc69 \n c. bactrianus \n mongoliaccggggaattaaaaggggccttttdc158 \n c. bactrianus \n austriaccggggaattaaaaggggccttttdc352 \n c. bactrianus \n iranccggggaattaaaaggggcctttthyb56f1 hybrid \n kazakhstangcgagcaccttaacgcgcactttthyb55f1 backcross \n kazakhstanccgaggaactaaaaggggccttttdc575uncertain originkazakhstanccgaggacttaaaagcggccctttthe parentheses indicate the reference alleles ( dromedary allele | bactrian allele ) identified from the whole -

secreting tumors are confined to structures derived from the foregut ( that is , the parotid , submandibular and sublingual glands and the mucus glands throughout the upper respiratory tract ) .\nthese glands are also associated with the larynx ( supraglottis and subglottis ) , nasopharynx and oropharynx ( tonsil and posterior tongue ) .\nthe tumor extends well beyond the visible and palpable limits of the salivary gland region .\nthis infiltrative capacity is the hallmark of this carcinoma because of which multiple local recurrences are common despite aggressive surgical and irradiation therapy .\nthe proliferating cell is a small cuboidal cell with a round hyperchromatic nucleus and scant cytoplasm .\nthis is of clinical significance since predominantly solid acc are found to be more aggressive and are associated with a worse prognosis than predominantly tubular or cribriform acc .\nacc occasionally invades regional lymph nodes by direct extension , but true embolic lymph node metastasis is rare .\nhowever , distant metastasis to organs other than lymph nodes is common , particularly late in the course of the disease , the lungs being the primary site followed by bones , the liver and the brain .\nit is a malignancy that reinforces the point that tumor growth rate and metastatic capability are independent tumor properties .\nclinical features depend on the site involved and the nerve affected . in nasopharyngeal localization ,\nthe symptoms most commonly found are epistaxis , progressive nasal stenosis , dysfunction of the eustachian tube and in relation to the invasion of the skull base , disorders of ocular motility , diplopia , facial pain , dysfunction of ix , x , xi and xii pairs of cranial nerves and more rarely , horner 's syndrome . wherever it arises\n, acc presents as a painful or a painless solid tumor mass with or without ulceration , cranial nerve palsy or paresis .\nthis case highlights the fact that acc may rarely have clinical and radiological features similar to that of a cyst .\na 50-year - old female reported to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery with the chief complaint of progressive dysphagia due to a swelling in relation to right oropharyngeal region .\npatient 's past medical history was unremarkable and personal history was negative for tobacco consumption .\nintraoral examination revealed a 4  4 cm swelling in relation to right oropharynx extending superiorly from soft palate inferiorly up to palatine tonsil medially till midline displacing uvula to the left side [ figure 1 ] .\nswelling was well - defined , soft , fluctuant , cystic in consistency , non - tender , non - pulsatile and was not fixed to the underlying tissues .\nintra oral photograph showing extension of the swelling computed tomography ( ct ) scan revealed a well - defined hypodense cystic mass with peripheral enhancement in relation to right parapharyngeal space .\naxial ct section was showing lesion extending laterally into the masticator space medially displacing the lateral wall of oropharynx with absence of bone destruction [ figure 2 ] .\nsagittal section revealed that the mass was extending superiorly from nasopharynx and inferiorly to the level of hyoid bone [ figure 3 ] .\nhigh vascular flow was not noted and thus , the possibility of low - flow lesion was suspected .\naxial ct section showing well defined hypodense cystic mass in right parapharygeal space sagittal ct section showing the lesion extending superiorly from nasopharynx inferiorly up to hyoid bone fine needle aspiration revealed a clear amber - colored fluid and about 20 ml was aspirated at a time [ figure 4 ] .\nfnac and ct scan was suggestive of a benign cystic lesion . a differential diagnosis of retention cyst and brachial cleft cyst was considered .\nphotograph showing amber - colored fluid on aspiration incisional biopsy was performed , which revealed cribriform pattern with uniform basaloid tumor cells with scant cytoplasm and basophilic angulated nucleus , arranged in nests and islands containing circular or ovoid cystic spaces giving swiss cheese appearance .\ntumor cells arranged in solid nests and islands without cystic spaces were also found in focal areas [ figure 5b ] .\n( a ) : photomicrograph revealing tumor cells arranged in cribriform pattern ( h&e stain , 40 ) , ( b ) : photomicrograph showing solid cell nests ( h&e stain , 200 ) total body scan performed was negative for distant metastases . surgical excision of mass was performed through transoral route under general anesthesia .\nwe preferred transoral approach than transcervical approach as the mass was in prestyloid region and was more prominent intraorally .\nintraoperatively mass was mimicking a cyst [ figure 6 ] . on gross examination of specimen , the surface was smooth and on palpation , was rubbery in consistency .\npostoperative radiation therapy was selected as supplemental treatment and patient remains disease free after 1 year 6 months [ figure 7 ] .\nacc occurs predominantly in fourth to sixth decade of life with a slight female predilection . in our case ,\nacc clinically is characterized as a slow - growing mass with a propensity to invade peripheral nerves with a high recurrence rate and metastases to other organs .\npain is usually a common and important associated symptom , occasionally occurring before clinical evidence of the disease .\nneoplastic cell neurotropism causes pain , which was not evident in our case , suggesting no invasion of tumor cells into adjacent peripheral nerves .\nthe fine - needle aspiration biopsy of acc characteristically shows small clusters or groups of basaloid tumor cells encircling the hyaline globule .\ncribriform  pattern where nests of tumor cells have a sieve - like or  swiss cheese  configuration .\npattern where the tumor nests and islands are completely filled with basaloid tumor cells without cystic spaces .\nthe cystic spaces may contain basophilic mucinous material or eosinophilic material . usually , the tumor islands are ultrastructurally surrounded by fibrous stroma or hyalinized stroma , which is replicated basal lamina . in most acc ,\nall three patterns can usually be observed , although the distribution varies greatly between different lesions .\ntumor is graded according to szanto et al.cribriform or tubular ( grade i ) , less than 30% solid ( grade ii ) , or greater than 30% solid ( grade iii ) .\nacc with high - grade transformation refers to the presence of a pleomorphic mitotically active high - grade carcinoma component arising in an otherwise conventional acc of any pattern / grade .\nthe transformed component is typically of a purely ductal phenotype with a solid or cribriform appearance . unlike conventional acc , which is characterized by small , hyperchromatic , monomorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm ,\nimmunohistochemistry reveals that the luminal tumor cells are diffusely positive for cytokeratin , epithelial membrane antigen , carcino embryonic antigen and cd117 ( c - kit ) indicating ductal origin and those that surround the pseudo cysts show positivity for s-100 , smooth muscle actin , calponin and variable positivity for cytokeratin suggestive of myoepithelial cell differentiation . over expression of p53 and\nthere is also strong reactivity for basement membrane components such as type iv collagen , laminin and heparan sulphate ( perlecan ) .\naffinity of tumor cells to proliferate along the basement membranes is responsible for frequent invasion of tumor cells into basement membrane - rich tissues such as peripheral nerves , blood vessels and skeletal muscles .\ncytogenetically , the most consistent , although not exclusive , reported alterations have been at chromosomes 6q , 9p and 17p12 - 13 regions .\nthe differential diagnosis of acc includes tumors that also exhibit tubular and cribriform structures such as polymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma ; tumors with basaloid cellular morphology such as basal cell adenoma and basal cell adenocarcinoma ; and tumors with a dual population of ductal and myoepithelial cells such as pleomorphic adenoma .\npolymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma occurs almost exclusively in the minor salivary glands and may contain overlapping histopathologic features with acc such as ductal , tubular and even cribriform growth .\nhowever , the presence of cuboidal or columnar cells containing pale and ovoid nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm is in contrast with the hyperchromatic and angulated cells of acc .\nin addition , polymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma shows low expression of c - kit compared with the high c - kit expression of acc .\npleomorphic adenoma can be identified by the presence of mesenchymal , especially cartilaginous differentiation in the stroma .\npleomorphic adenoma expresses glial fibrillary acidic protein and cd57 , but accs do not react with these markers .\nbasal cell adenoma can be identified by the presence of a capsule and lack of stromal and perineural invasion .\nbasal cell adenocarcinoma may be more difficult to differentiate with solid acc ; however , lack of clear cytoplasm and hyperchromatic , angulated nuclei with the presence of peripheral palisaded nuclei in the former may aid in diagnosis .\nalso , most tumors displaying a solid component of acc will often display areas of cribriform or tubular growth .\nspiro et al . found the following factors to be important in prognosis : site , size and extension into adjacent structures .\nperineural invasion and bone destruction was not present in our case , favoring good prognosis .\nthe underlying principle in the treatment of acc is that tumor cells extend well beyond the clinical or radiographic margins and this tumor undergoes not only perineural invasion but also perineural spread .\ntherefore , it generally requires excision with the widest margins possible and postoperative radiation therapy of 6000 - 7500 cgy . the best treatment considered for acc is unanimously radical surgical resection followed by radiotherapy .\nhowever , in cases of nasopharyngeal extension , the frequent perineural and perivascular infiltrations association with the anatomical structures of the nasopharynx make the surgical approach risky on account of technical difficulties , substantially due to the proximity of surgical margins to critical neural and vascular structures .\nsurgical treatment , therefore , is often characterized by incomplete excision , consequently leading to increased frequency of local recurrence .\nthe 5-year survival rate is 75% but 10-year survival rate is only 20% and survival rate at 15 years is about 10% .\noverall prognosis relates to several factors histologically solid patterns bode worse than cribriform pattern . in our case , lesion was cribriform type , which has better prognosis .\nclinical size > 4 cm is indicative of more subclinical spread and is associated with a worse prognosis . delayed diagnosis and treatment\nsurgical margins that are not clear or close , despite postoperative radiation therapy are also associated with a poor prognosis , which is the single most important factor associated with local recurrence .\nclinical and ct findings were suggestive of a benign cystic mass and diagnosis of acc was not realized until pathologic sections were studied . in view of histopathologic findings , postoperative irradiation was selected as supplemental treatment .\nthe present case highlights the need to be aware of unusual presentation of acc as soft , fluctuant cystic mass ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the adenoid cystic carcinoma is a relatively rare epithelial tumor of the major and minor salivary glands , accounting for about 1% of all malignant tumor of the oral and maxillofacial regions . \n peak incidence occurs between the 5th and 6th decades of life . \n the clinical and pathological findings typical of this tumor include slow growth , peri -

funded population - based national hpv vaccination program ( nhvp ) commenced in australia in 2007 .\nthis program aimed to deliver a course of three vaccinations of the quadrivalent hpv vaccine gardasil to girls aged 12 to 13 years , with a two - year  catch - up program  for 13- to 18-year - old girls through schools and a two - year  catch - up program  for women aged 18 to 26 years through general practices and community - based programs .\nthe vaccination coverage for school - aged girls is now 70% . in early 2009 , two years after the nhvp had commenced , the royal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynaecologists set up a quality improvement program in colposcopy ( c - quip ) with the aim of improving care for women with screen - detected abnormalities .\none of the key drivers of the c - quip program is that the number of women who are treated with a low - grade eventual diagnosis on pathology is minimised .\nthis audit standard was chosen due to concern regarding the use of excisional treatment in young women with a good prognosis .\nwe set out to examine the trends in excisional treatment in australia over the last decade and whether the nhvp or c - quip program had been associated with alterations in the incidence of cervical excisional treatment in young women .\ndata were obtained from four mandated national data collections to develop a single dataset for this study . to provide a population denominator , census - derived point estimates of the age - specific female population in australia for the period 2004 to 2013 were obtained from the australian bureau of statistics ( abs ) .\ndata regarding the number of histological diagnoses of cervical dysplasia were obtained from the australian institute of health and welfare ( aihw ) . the aihw dataset reports statistics from the cervical screening registers of each state and territory , compiled into the national dataset by the aihw for purposes of national monitoring and audit .\naustralia has no overarching dataset regarding all procedures in both inpatient and outpatient ( office ) settings . to capture the most complete dataset possible\nthe first source was the aihw national procedural dataset , collected under the auspice of the australian health ministers ' advisory council ( ahmac ) through the national health information agreement .\nthese data are collected as specified in the national minimum data sets relating to hospitals and day procedure facilities , pooling data supplied by state and territory health authorities .\nit is important to recognize that these data provide information only about procedures performed on admitted patients in hospitals and day surgery facilities .\n morbidity ( kappa 0.86 ) . to cover excisional procedures performed in nonadmitted patients ,\nour other source of procedural information was medicare data from the australian national medical benefits scheme ( mbs ) billing dataset .\nthe mbs billing data report procedural services that are performed by a registered provider for services that qualify for medicare benefit and for which a claim has been processed by medicare australia .\nthus , these are complimentary data to the aihw , capturing both inpatient procedures and outpatient ( rooms ) procedures billed through medicare\n. the mbs dataset does not include services provided by hospital doctors to public patients in public hospitals ( procedures captured in the aihw dataset ) or services that qualify for a benefit under the department of veterans ' affairs ( dva ) national treatment account . the aihw and mbs datasets are complementary and obviously not mutually exclusive , so we separately analysed each dataset .\nanalysis of variance was undertaken using regression with calculation of r and adjusted r ( ar ) values , and comparisons were made using 2  2 tables to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals , with chi - square to calculate p - values .\nthis study received approval from the australian national university human research ethics committee ( protocol 2015/347 ) .\nnational data regarding the incidence of low - grade ( hpv effect + cin1 ) , high - grade ( cin2 + cin3 ) , and endocervical dysplasia ( adenocarcinoma in situ ) for the period from 2004 to 2013 inclusive were used with the abs population estimates to calculate age - stratified incidence rates ( number of histologically confirmed cases per 1000 women ) between the prevaccination epoch ( 20042007 ) and the postvaccination epoch ( 20082013 ) .\nthe incidence of low - grade change fell across all three age - bands ( figure 1 ) : 20 to 24 years ( p < 0.005 ) ; 25 to 34 years ( p < 0.005 ) ; and 35 years or older ( p < 0.005 ) .\nthe incidence of high - grade change fell in the 20-to-24-year group ( p < 0.005 ) but rose slightly for the older age groups ( figure 2 ) : 25 to 34 years ( p < 0.005 ) and 35 years and older ( p < 0.005 ) .\nthe incidence of glandular dysplasia was unchanged for the age group 20 to 24 years ( p = 0.09 ) , increased for the age group 25 to 34 years ( p < 0.005 ) , and remained unchanged for the age group 35 years or older ( p = 0.15 ) ( figure 3 ) .\nthe mbs billing dataset was the smaller of the two , recording 82521 excisional treatments during the ten - year study period .\nthe aihw procedural dataset contained 153421 excisional procedures over the same period , 86% more than the mbs .\nage - stratified incidence rates for all excisional treatments ( loop excision + cone biopsy ) were calculated separately for the mbs and aihw datasets . in the mbs\ndataset the incidence rate of excisional treatment fell significantly in all age groups across the study period ( figure 4 ) .\nthe aihw dataset showed significant reductions for the age groups 20 to 24 years ( p < 0.005 ) and 25 to 34 years ( p\n< 0.005 ) ; however , there was no significant change for women 35 years or older ( p = 0.06 ) ( figure 5 ) .\nwe examined the association between excisional treatment and the c - quip program in two ways .\nfirstly the rate of all excisional treatments ( loop excision + cone biopsy ) per high - grade diagnosis ( cin2 + cin3 + adenocarcinoma in situ ) was calculated across the study period . using this comparison ,\nthe smaller mbs dataset revealed falls across all three age - bands ( figure 6 ) .\nthe aihw procedural dataset also revealed significant reductions in the rate for women in all age groups ( figure 7 ) .\nsecondly , to examine the rate of loop excision alone we calculated the rates using all nonglandular histological diagnoses ( lgea + hgea ) as the denominator in both datasets . in the mbs dataset\nhowever , the c - quip epoch was not associated with any change in the rate of loop excision in any age group : 20 to 24 years ( p = 0.29 ) ; 25 to 34 years ( p = 0.21 ) ; and 35 years or more ( p = 0.34 ) . in the aihw dataset there was no change in the rate in any age group ; the c - quip epoch was not associated with any change ( figure 9 ) .\nin australia over the last decade there has been a decline in the incidence of low - grade squamous dysplasia across all age groups , particularly noticeable in women aged 20 to 24 years .\nthe incidence of high - grade squamous dysplasia has also fallen in young women , with the fall in rate beginning well before any plausible effect from the vaccination program , but with slight but significant increases in older age groups .\nthe rate of glandular abnormality remained unchanged in women aged 20 to 24 years and those aged 35 years or older , although there has been a significant increase in women aged 25 to 34 years . at a population level ,\nthe incidence rate of excisional treatments has fallen significantly in women aged less than 35 years . however , while the mbs dataset revealed small but significant reductions in the rate of loop excision per diagnosis of squamous dysplasia , the aihw showed no significant changes .\nthe c - quip epoch was not associated with a fall in the rate of excisional treatment in any age group .\na strength of this study is that it has used multiple national databases to build up a picture of the trends in excisional treatment of squamous and glandular dysplasia .\nhowever , it has not been possible to examine the use of ablation treatments ( such as radical diathermy or laser ) .\nthe use of excisional treatment for cervical dysplasia is an important component of cervical cancer prevention , but we have been unable to identify any published studies examining trends in the incidence rate of excisional treatment in other countries . for this reason it is difficult to determine whether the national trends found in australia are consistent with changes in clinical practice elsewhere in the world .\nit is noteworthy that the reduction in the use of excisional treatment in younger women began before the introduction of the national hpv vaccination program in 2007 .\nperceptions of potential overuse of excisional treatment in nulliparous women , and indeed for young women whose family is not yet complete , prompted initiation of the c -

the replacement of these water molecules is unfavorable in \n terms of binding free energy , and therefore that \n interpretation is doubtful . in this study\n, we present a theoretical \n paper of the thermodynamics of these binding poses to clarify the \n unexpected behavior of the five ligands and to shed light on the question \n why compound c is not found in the same binding pose as

.\nall ligand protein complexes \n were solvated with tip4p water molecules \n in an octahedral box .\nperiodic boundary conditions were applied and \n a minimum distance of 15  between the solute and the edge of \n the box was chosen .\nequilibration of the systems was performed according \n to an established protocol previously developed in our group .\na langevin thermostat was used to keep the temperature \n at 300 k. the pressure of 1 bar was kept by using an isotropic implementation \n of the berendsen barostat .\nthe time step was set to 2 fs and coordinates \n were saved every 10 ps for a 200 ns trajectory without restraints .\nfive representative conformations were obtained by clustering a \n 200 ns trajectory of each ligand using a hierarchical agglomerative \n ( bottom - up ) approach implemented in cpptraj .\nfive clusters were used as we had to find a compromise between calculation \n effort and accuracy .\nthe 2000 water molecules closest to the complex \n of every representative conformer were retained , they were again solvated \n in an octahedral box and equilibrated . during equilibration and simulation \n of the five clusters we applied\ncoordinate restraints to the whole \n protein and the ligand , as it is required for the gist analysis .\nevery cluster was simulated for 100 ns and coordinates \n were saved every 100 ps .\nthe method \n calculates the free energy of water molecules on a grid based approach \n for a single conformation of the solute .\nrecently published studies \n highlighted that gist is a valid and useful approach to study biomolecular \n systems in combination with molecular dynamics simulations , allowing one to differentiate between entropic and enthalpic contributions \n to the total free energy .\nfor all calculated values , the references \n state , to which all values refer , is pure water .\na detailed description \n of how entropic and enthalpic terms are calculated is given by nguyen \n et al . in all our calculations ,\n, the free energy \n of solvation of a solute gsolv can \n be written according to eq 1.1it is defined as the integral over \n the solvation \n free energies gsolv(q ) of a solute determined for each of its conformations q times the probability p(q ) to find \n the solute in this conformation . to calculate gsolv(q ) for a particular conformation q ,\nin this paper we consider the occurrence of different relevant conformations \n by simulating an unrestraint complex system .\nequation 1 is used to calculate the \n solvation free energy gsolv from \n the solvation free energies of the five restrained solute conformers \n gsolv(q ) ( the integral \n is approximated with a discrete sum ) .\nthe probabilities p(q ) are the relative cluster sizes , i.e. , the number \n of structures per cluster .\nwe want to emphasize that gist covers the thermodynamic \n properties of the water only and it does not cover the entropic and \n enthalpic differences of the ligand and the protein upon binding . \n\nas continuous \n grids are difficult to visualize , we tried to enhance the visualization \n of our results by extracting the most abundant water positions from \n the grid values .\nto find sensible water positions , a script \n was written to search \n for the grid point with the highest water density .\nfrom this grid \n point and the surrounding grid points the density of one water molecule \n is subtracted .\nafterward , the next most abundant grid point is found \n by the program and again the density of one water molecule is subtracted . \n\na 1% residual density is \n necessary due to boundary effects . to assign thermodynamic values \n to the refined water positions ,\nthe thermodynamic value ( e.g. , entropy , \n enthalpy , or free energy ) of the analyzed grid points are averaged \n ( density weighted ) .\nfigure 3 shows the results for the total entropy of the water molecules \n in a grid representation ( a ) and with representative water molecules \n ( b ) .\neach depicted water molecule has an entropy value larger than \n 3.5 kcal / mol .\nan analogous procedure can be applied to all other thermodynamic \n values of the gist output ; see ref ( 17 ) . aside from an easier visualization\nan additional \n advantage of this representation is that less abundant ( less populated ) \n grid points are weighted to a lesser extent and therefore points with \n high entropy due to low occupancy are not overinterpreted .\ncomparison \n of the grid visualization ( a ) and with representative \n water molecule representation ( b ) .\nthe grid points with a high entropic \n penalty ( ts > \n 3.5 \n kcal / mol , pink grid ) and the refined water positions with a high entropic \n penalty ( ts > \n 3.5 \n kcal / mol , blue spheres ) are shown for compound c. results are very \n similar whether refined water positions or raw grid representation \n is used for analysis , but visualization clearly benefits from further \n processing of raw grid results .\nin contrast to the visualization of single water molecules \n and \n their corresponding properties , we also aimed for a quantitative description \n of the binding thermodynamics . therefore , we summed the thermodynamic \n value of interest ( density - weighted ) over all grid points of the ligand \n binding region to capture differences in the overall thermodynamics . \n to ensure that roughly the same volume is used to estimate the water \n properties of the pocket for every simulation ,\nall grid points within \n 5  of the ligand , the asp-290 , or the glu-245 residue ( shown \n in figure 3 ) are used \n to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the pocket . as the gist analysis omits the enthalpic \n interactions between the ligand and the protein ,\ntherefore , we used the lie \n implementation of the ambertools15 package to estimate the enthalpy \n of ligand binding . in lie\n, eq 2 is applied to estimate the free energy of \n solvation:2ul  s describes \n the difference in interaction energy between the \n unbound solvated ligand and the ligand in complex with the protein \n plus solvation .\nif we set the parameters  =  = 1 and \n  = 0 , we obtain the difference in interaction energy u for the ligand in the bound and unbound state . in lie \n\nin contrast , the method with the suggested \n parameters (  =  = 1 and  = 0 ) is a measure for \n the change in interaction enthalpy between the ligand in the bound \n and in the unbound state . therefore , this method includes the interaction \n of the ligand with the protein , which is not captured by the gist \n analysis .\nthis method was further used to analyze the difference in \n the binding enthalpy between a protonated and the neutral form of \n the ligands c and d. implicit \n solvent calculations can be employed for the calculation \n of pka values . we make use of the openeye \n software protein_pka which is based on their poisson \nthe actual pka value is derived from a thermodynamic cycle : the solvation \n energy of the protonated and deprotonated form of the residue ( amino \n acid or ligand ) is computed by solving the poisson \nboltzmann \n equation whereas the pka value of the \n residue in aqueous solution is taken from literature or experiment . \n\nhowever , sampling of the different possibilities \n of the charge states ( residue 1 protonated and residue 2 protonated , \n residue 1 protonated and residue 2 deprotonated , etc . ) of the residues \n is necessary : protein_pka makes use of monte carlo sampling to simulate \n the effect of different charge states .\nthe protein structures were \n prepared by protein_pka ( addition of hydrogen atoms and rebuilding \n missing heavy atoms ) .\nas discussed in a previously \n published study by czodrowski et al . \n the role of water molecules in the proximity of the binding pocket \n can play a significant role in explaining the two different binding \n modes . to simplify the complex process \n of solvation , we distinguish in a first approximation between water \n molecules with a negative and a positive free energy value compared \n with water molecules in bulk .\nif the free energy of the water molecule \n is more positive than in bulk water , we can gain free energy of binding \n when the water is removed from the protein and released into bulk . \n\nwater molecules with a positive free energy value in comparison to \n bulk water are either entropically constrained , i.e. , restricted in \n their movement with no or too low enthalpic compensation ( entropically \n unfavored water position , e.g. , formation of a water wire or water \n polygons in an apolar environment ) , or have in general too low enthalpic \n interactions in comparison with bulk water ( enthalpically unfavored \n water position , e.g. , hydrophobic pocket ) . water molecules with a negative free energy value compared to bulk \n water often show strong enthalpic interactions .\nthese strong enthalpic \n interactions lead to a highly favorable enthalpy of solvation . however , \n the phase space that these enthalpically strong bound water molecules \n can occupy ( e.g. , water near a charged residue ) is usually restricted , \n resulting in a low entropy contribution .\ntherefore , the very favorable \n enthalpy of solvation is partially compensated by entropic restrictions . \n\nthis phenomenon is called entropy - enthalpy compensation . as neither enthalpy nor entropy is able to describe the differences \n in free energy completely ,\nit is necessary \n to investigate both enthalpy and entropy to identify water molecules \n with a positive free energy contribution . to explain why compound \n c is not found in pose d and vice versa , \n analyses of all possible binding poses and different protonation states \n were performed ( summarized in figure 4 )\nonce more we would like to point out that the two \n ligands only differ in the position of the amino group , which is in \n para - position in compound c and in meta - position in d. overview of all investigated \n structures .\ncompound c as crystallized \n ( pose c ) and compound d as found in the crystal structure ( pose d ) \n ( gray box ) . to explain the surprising binding mode flip an analysis \n of compound d in pose c and vice versa ( red box )\nis also required . \n to rationalize the complete binding behavior we also have to account \n for the possibility of different protonation states of the ligands \n within the binding pocket ( blue boxes ) .\nwe start the thermodynamic analysis by investigating the \n free energy \n contributions of water molecules for the four uncharged states ( red \n box of figure 4 ) . as \n already pointed out by czodrowski et al .\nthe differences between compound c and d in terms of physicochemical \n properties are very subtle at first glance .\nredocking for both compounds \n was successful but when compound d was docked into the crystal structure \n of compound c binding pose c was obtained .\nthe same result was obtained \n for the cross - docking of compound c into the crystal structure of \n compound d. to rationalize the binding behavior we started with \n analyzing the \n solvent structure of the neutral ligands in the binding pose from \n the crystal structure and in the docked binding pose .\nvisualization of water entropies from the gist \n calculation for \n compounds c and d in both binding poses .\nblue spheres indicate water \n molecules with a low / unfavorable entropy ( ts > 3.5 kcal / mol ) in a radius of 5  \n around the ligands and the shown asp-290 and glu-245 residues . for \n both compounds binding\npose c reveals more entropically disfavored \n water molecules in the back - pocket ( highlighted with red ovals ) .\nentropically unfavorable water \n sites in respect to bulk water ( ts > 3.5 kcal / mol ) are shown in figure 5 as blue spheres . \n for compound d ( figure 5 : bottom )\nwe find that the binding pose d ( left ) has significantly \n fewer entropically unfavorable water molecules than binding pose c \n ( right ) .\nthus , for compound d the binding pose d is entropically favored \n over pose c. some of these entropically unfavorable water molecules \n do not show strong enthalpic interactions with the ligand or the protein \n or other water molecules .\nthe free energy of these water molecule \n is high in comparison to bulk water molecules . in the buried pocket \n ( red oval in figure 5 )\nsuch water molecules with a positive contribution to the free energy \n are found , which can be replaced by a ligand , as found for compound \n d in pose d. however , also for compound c binding pose d shows \n significantly \n fewer ordered water molecules ( figure 5 : top ) , indicating that our analysis is missing important \n details for this ligand . to shed light on this behavior , enthalpic \n and entropic contributions to solvation as well as the resulting free \n energy of water molecules within\nthe previously mentioned 5  \n radius to the binding pocket are studied and results listed in table 1 .\nthe first four rows list \n the results of the gist calculations for \n the uncharged ligands . for compound\nd we find that pose d is energetically \n favorable ( gd(pose d ) < gd(pose c ) ) and that this difference in free \n energy has its origin in the water entropy .\nthis is in good agreement \n with the visualization and the results obtained earlier by czodrowski \n et al . the solvent calculations with watermap \n and szmap also identified two to three  unhappy/hydrophobic  \n\nwater molecules which are replaced by compound d in the buried pocket . \n as a reminder : \nunhappy/hydrophilic water molecules \n correspond to water molecules with a positive free energy value compared \n with bulk water .\nthis explains the binding mode of compound d but \n would also mean that compound c should be found in the crystal structure \n with binding pose d. the free energy for compound c in pose d is also \n lower than in pose c ( gc(pose d ) \n < gc(pose c ) . the previously \n published explanation that the displacement of an enthalpically strong \n bound water molecule is responsible for this change in the binding \n is doubtful , as this should lead to a decrease in binding affinity .\nthese results indicate that the binding pose of compound c can not \n be explained by solvation analysis alone . therefore\n, further investigation \n of the binding of the ligand c is required . a more detailed investigation \n of the binding site and the residues in close proximity to the ligand \n revealed that the binding site shows two negatively charged residues \n ( asp-351 , glu-245 ) in the buried pocket together with a positively \n charged lysine ( lys-232 ) , forming salt bridges with each other .\nfurthermore , \n a negatively charged aspartate ( asp-290 ) is close to the amino group \n of the solvent exposed ligand .\nhence , protonation of the aniline group \n and formation of a salt bridge with the deprotonated aspartate residue \n ( shown in figure 6 ) \n could occur as no other positively charged group is in close proximity .\npossible \n salt bridge formed between the negatively charged aspartate \n ( asp-290 ) residue and the positively charged amino group of ligand \n c. we therefore performed pka calculations \n for the compounds c and d for their native x - ray pose as well as their \n docking pose .\nthe reported values correspond \n to the pka values of the amino group in \n compounds c and d. amino \n group is definitely not protonated \n at physiological ph : this can be concluded due to the pka value which is computed to be below 0 .\nthe results of the pka calculations \n showed that indeed compound c in binding pose c is likely protonated , \n whereas for all other structures it is unlikely that the ligands are \n protonated at neutral ph .\ntherefore , we performed the gist calculations \n for the protonated \n form of the ligands c and d ( table 1 ; row 58 ) . again the entropy for binding pose \n d is higher than for pose c. in terms of free energy the compounds \n show the correct trend , but the difference between the different compounds \n and the different binding poses are smaller than for the neutral compounds . \n as the method s error ( max standard error of the mean for the \n gist calculation : 3.1 kcal / mol ) is in the same range , we have to further \n investigate the system to ensure the trend is correct .\nthe enthalpic \n interactions between two charged residues ( only present with a positively \n charged ligand ) are significantly stronger than interactions between \n a charge and a dipole or two dipoles . since gist\ndoes not cover the \n interaction energy between ligand and protein this could further help \n to explain the binding mode .\ntherefore , we hypothesize that the strong \n enthalpic interaction of the salt bridge in the solvent exposed binding \n mode overcompensates the entropic unfavorable contributions of the \n ordered water molecules in the buried pocket . to ensure that \n the pka calculations \n are correct ,\nwe present further evidence that the ligand is indeed \n protonated and this is responsible for the binding mode flip .\nunfortunately , \n protonation states usually can not be determined by x - ray crystallography \n for most biomolecular systems and techniques sensitive to proton location , \n like neutron scattering , are rarely used within drug design projects . \n\nhowever , by looking at pka values for \n related molecules it becomes evident that p - phenylenediamine \n is significantly more basic ( pka = 6.2 ) \n than the m - phenylenediamine with a pka of 4.98 , indicating \n that compound c is much easier to protonate than compound d at physiological \n ph .\nthis is corroborated by the pka calculations \n of the protein - complex . in terms of biomolecular recognition\nthe position \n of the amino group in para - position ( n  o distance 2.8  ) \n is closer to the carboxyl group of the aspartate than the amino group \n in the meta - position ( n  o distance 3.5  ) .\nthe difference \n in the pka values might also influence \n the solvation thermodynamics as the amount of the respective protonated \n species differ between the two compounds .\nhowever , the absolute number \n of protonated species is considered small and therefore these contributions \n are likely to be minor without a stabilizing functional group in vicinity . \n\nwhile at the first glance the change of the amino group from ortho- \n to meta - position does not seem to be significant , it fundamentally \n changed the properties of the molecule . to further analyze the \n idea that the compound can be protonated \n we used the lie tool of the ambertools package .\nwe wanted to choose a method which explicitly includes \n the interaction of the protein and the ligand , as this kind of interaction \n is omitted by the gist analysis . to obtain the difference between \n the interaction energy of the \n ligand in complex and as free ligand two simulations were necessary . \n\nfurther , we are interested in the change of binding energy \n between protonated and unprotonated state ( shown in the last two columns \n of table 3 ) .\nas expected , \n the results show that the interaction between the ligand and the surrounding \n ( protein and water ) is enhanced when the ligand is protonated for \n both binding poses . still , the gain in ( more favorable ) interaction \n energy for position c ( 15.8 kcal / mol ) is higher compared to \n the gain in pose d ( 10.8 kcal / mol ) for compound c. it is likely \n that this gain in enthalpy is responsible for the binding pose change . \n for binding pose c\nthis enthalpic gain helps to compensate the entropic \n penalty of the water molecules in the buried pocket and therefore \n stabilizing the binding pose of compound c. for both binding poses \n of compound d , we see a gain in interaction energy similarly to compound \n c in position c ( 16.2 and 16.0 kcal / mol ) . in contrast to compound \n c , compound d is much more difficult to protonate and therefore the \n energy gain may not be enough to compensate for the energy necessary \n for the protonation . looking at table 3 from a different angle : although we already see that \n in the neutral \n form compound c slightly prefers pose c ( 1.9 kcal / mol ) , this \n could be in the range of the method s error .\nthe preference \n enhances for the positive form of compound c and is significantly \n larger ( 7.0 kcal / mol ) than the error of the method . for compound \n d\n, we found a preference for pose d over pose c ( 5.0 kcal / mol ) \n for both the positive and neutral form .\nfurther evidence that \n the preference of the neutral compound c \n for pose c is not significant brought the application of the mm / pbsa \n method to this problem . with this method we found that \n compound c prefers pose d in the unprotonated state by 6 kcal / mol , \n whereas for the charged compound we could not find any preference \n (  < 1 kcal / mol ) for one of the two binding poses .\nthis finding further supports \n our hypothesis that compound c has to be protonated , when it is found \n in pose c. enthalpy ( lie ) calculations without solvent and further \n information \n about the mm / gb(pb)sa calculations are given in the si .\nto summarize : binding pose d is favorable for compound \n d , not only \n but also due to entropic contributions from the water molecules being \n ( the phase space water molecules can occupy ) more favorable than in \n pose c. hence , the binding pose of compound d is to a large extend \n determined by the entropic contribution of the water molecules .\nthis \n explains how water can influence the affinity and specificity of ligand \n binding sites .\nthe importance of water \n for ligand binding is already well established . in the presented case\nthe replacement of entropically hindered \n water with respect to bulk results in a gain in free energy .\nin contrast , \n there are cases reported in literature where the enthalpy gain by \n formation of a water mediated hydrogen bond is larger than the entropic \n cost of restricting the phase space of the water molecules . for binding pose c\n, the entropy of the \n water molecules in the binding \n pocket is unfavorable in comparison to the water molecules in pose \n d , but compound c is protonated , leading to strong enthalpic interactions . \n\nour findings confirm once more that ligand binding depends \n on the balance between entropy and enthalpy .\nthe relative importance \n of the enthalpic and entropic contribution might change dramatically \n upon subtle modifications in ligand chemistry .\nour study also highlights \n the already known fact that enthalpy alone is not a good measurement \n for free energy , a fact often forgotten \n in medicinal chemistry when focusing solely on direct protein \nfurthermore , the ph effect on binding affinities and \n binding modes \n is often neglected . indeed\nthe pka of \n a ligand influences the binding affinity and selectivity , but also \n the binding of a ligand affects the pka of the ligand and the protein , as shown \n in this study .\nour analysis shows that \n the combination of in silico analysis tools \n can unravel the origin of different binding poses .\nthe present study \n provides an explanation of binding modes and rationalizes , based on \n thermodynamics , the observed binding mode flips .\nwe show how a minor \n change in the structure of a ligand leads to major structural changes , \n which could result in a misinterpretation of structure  activity \n relationships .\nthe binding pose of compound d is by a large extend \n determined by releasing entropically unfavored ( with respect to bulk \n water ) water molecules from the binding pocket into bulk upon binding . \n for a second compound c , very similar to the first one ,\nthe enthalpic interactions that play a key role in one of the binding \n poses are strongly related to the protonation of the amino group in \n this ligand . we encourage to carefully investigate protonation states , \n if functional groups are present which may or may not be protonated \n in the environment of another charged group with opposite sign .\nseemingly \n subtle changes in the chemical structure can significantly alter the \n physicochemical properties of certain groups . as the obtained results \n go beyond the limit of chemical intuition , the computational methodology \n presented can be of value for medicinal chemistry programs .\nthe enhanced thermodynamic understanding \n of such binding flips \n can help to improve binding pose prediction of unknown ligands . while \n we have to admit that the extensive study presented here is most likely \n beyond the scope of typical drug design programs , the ligand binding \n poses analyzed here\nwould most likely not have been correctly predicted \n by any state - of - the - art structure - based drug design methodology .\nnevertheless , \n such challenging cases can be used to strengthen our ability to accurately \n predict binding

earlier first homosexual encounter ( 19.8 years ) and slightly more male partners ( 3.0 ) in the past month than participants aged 30 years ( 24.4 years , 2.8 , respectively ) .\nthe proportions of consistent condom use ( i.e. , every time ) in the past month and at most recent anal sex were lower in younger participants ( 53.8% and 78.1% , respectively ) than older participants ( 60.2% and 82.7% , respectively ) .\nthis study investigated the sexual behavior of chinese msm population using a questionnaire with rrts .\ndifferent rrt models were used with the intention to obtain more honest responses to three kinds of sensitive questions . to the best of our knowledge ,\nthis is the first time that diverse rrt models have been used to investigate both quantitative and qualitative behavioral characteristics in chinese msm population .\nthe participation rate of 95% in this rrt survey is higher than that reported in studies using anonymous telephone survey ( 57% ) or anonymous structured questionnaire in direct interviews ( 89.5% ) .\nthe high anonymity resulting from the survey techniques may have removed participants concerns in compromising their privacy and , therefore , contributed to the high participation rate .\nother factors such as the short length of the questionnaire and peer - referral recruitment mechanism may have further encouraged participation in this study .\nthe rrt estimate of age at the first sexual encounter with a male partner in our study is 21.7 years , which is younger than that reported by a study using a direct interview with an anonymous questionnaire in a cross - sectional survey of the msm population in eastern china .\na case  control study on the msm population in southwestern china reported that the average age at the first sexual encounter with a man among the hiv - positive cases was 21.7 years , compared with 22.0 years among the hiv - negative controls .\nour estimate of the age related to msm debut homosexual encounter using rrt is the same as that for the hiv - positive cases , but slightly younger than that for the hiv - negative controls reported in the case  control study . for the number of male sex partners in the past month ,\na study among migrant msm in beijing reported that the median number of male sex partners was 3 in the past 6 months , which is close to our estimate but the reporting period is much longer than that of our study .\nother studies reported more sex partners among chinese msm population in the period of the past 6 months before the survey .\nan online survey conducted among msm in beijing reported that the median number of male sex partners in the past 6 months was 5 whereas the overall median number of male sex partners of chinese msm in the past 6 months was estimated to be 1.5 by a review article based on the studies published during 20002010 .\nin addition to the difference in reporting period , some studies were conducted several years earlier than the current study and the pattern of sexual behavior among msm population may have changed with time .\nmost studies on condom use among msm population in china reported the pattern of use at last sexual act and consistent use in a 6-month period . a study among 20,843 msm in 16 cities in china\nreported that self - reported condom use at last homosexual encounter increased from 58% in 2006 to 81% in 2009 whereas the consistent condom use rate in the past 6 months increased from 28% to 49% during the same period . in china 's united nations general assembly special session ( ungass )\nreport 2010 , the estimated rate of condom use at last anal sex among msm surveyed in sentinel surveillance programs was 73.1% .\nour rrt estimate of consistent condom use in the past month is higher than that reported in 2009 in the aforementioned study .\nhowever , the shorter length of reporting period ( i.e. , 1 month ) may contribute to the higher estimate in our study , as it is obviously more challenging to be a consistent condom user for 6 months than for only 1 month . a more recent study on money boys ( i.e. , male sex workers engaging in same - sex sexual activities for economic benefits ) reported 80.2% of the participants used condoms consistently with male sex partners in the past 3 months , which is much higher than the rrt estimate of consistent condom use in our study .\nthis may be caused by the selection of a special study population ( i.e. , money boys ) perceiving higher risks and , therefore , more protective behavior . for condom use at last anal sex with a male partner ,\nour rrt estimate is slightly lower than that reported in 2009 ( 81% ) in the same aforementioned study using questionnaire and interview for data collection , but higher than that reported in china 's ungass report 2010 ( 73.1% ) , which used questionnaire for the survey at sentinels across the whole country .\nconsistent condom use has been proven an effective behavioral strategy to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) and/or hiv and remains the most effective barrier method against hiv transmission . in china ,\npublic health programs targeting msm population were launched more than a decade ago , and condom use was included in the majority of these programs .\nthis may have resulted in the increasing use of condoms among msm to protect against hiv and stis as reflected in the relatively high rrt estimate of condom use at last sex with a male partner in our study . moreover ,\nthe risks of the behavioral characteristics investigated in this study were consistently higher in msm aged < 30 years ( i.e. , having earlier first sexual encounter , more number of sex partners and lower rate of consistent condom use in the past month , and lower rate of condom use at most recent anal sex ) than older msm . nonetheless , such phenomenon was not observed in this population for other demographic features such as marital status ( single vs. married ) , residence ( beijing resident vs. non - beijing resident ) , length of residence in beijing ( < 2 years vs.  2 years ) , ethnicity ( han vs. minorities ) , and education ( high school or below vs. college or above ) . for these\nabove mentioned demographic characteristics , the risks were higher in a subpopulation for some but not all behavioral characteristics under studied .\nthis suggests that younger msm population ( aged < 30 years ) may be a priority target for intervention programs aiming to reduce the risk behaviors investigated by our study . in summary , this study explored the profile of risk behaviors among msm population in beijing by employing a questionnaire with rrt in a sample of participants .\ncompared with the survey using anonymous questionnaires or direct interviews , the msm population in the current survey using rrt started their first sexual encounter at a younger age had more male partners and lower rate of consistent condom use during anal sex with male partners , especially in younger msm aged < 30 years .\nthese results suggest that rrt might be a useful tool to obtain more truthful feedback on sensitive information such as sexual behavior from the respondents\n. meanwhile , rrt might be particularly valuable in traditional chinese settings where msm are trying to avoid the stigma incurred and , therefore , incline to respond evasively to conventional direct questionnaires or interviews .\nthe participants of the study were recruited through peer - referrals and internet advertisements which may result in a sample with limited representativeness and reflect the difference of rrt estimate as compared to the estimate using conventional survey techniques .\nmoreover , we did not collect the data using a direct questionnaire simultaneously and thus could not compare the results from the direct questionnaire and that from rrt in the same study population .\nbesides , due to the nature of rrt , participant - level data are not available from the rrt survey and , therefore , preclude more detailed analysis based on individual data .\nfurthermore , the reporting period concerning sexual behavior with male partners and condom use was designed as 1 month , which is different from the period of 6 months used in most studies and makes difficult comparison of the results with other similar studies .\nsupplementary information is linked to the online version of the paper on the chinese medical journal website .\nthis work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china ( no . 81273188 ) and the priority academic program development ( papd ) of jiangsu higher education institutions .\nthis work was supported by the national natural science foundation of

whether there were consequences in male offspring remains to be ascertained .\nmore recently , models such as the agouti mouse have shown that transgenerational influences can result in offspring predisposed to a pathological state such as obesity , in itself a grave predisposing factor for chronic morbidities .   with more populations globally adopting a westernized lifestyle (\nthat which could be associated with living in northern / western europe and usa ) , there is the real possibility for a sudden surge in cancers of the breast , colon , prostate , and uterus in areas that hitherto would not have seen large rates of incidence of these conditions ; in many of these regions , the question will be whether there will be a healthcare infrastructure capable of coping with markedly increased numbers of cases and , capable of providing appropriate treatment and after - patient care . as far back as the 1960 's\n, there was recognition of worldwide region - specific differences in breast cancer incidence and , correlations between calorie , protein or fat consumption , and risk were noted .\neven then , in addition to environmental carcinogen exposures , a hormone - mediated difference in susceptibility to breast cancer among us - resident women of different ethnic backgrounds was observed .\nbreast adipose tissue may act as a reservoir for lipophilic genotoxic carcinogens [ 12 , 13 ] , but still there is likely a requirement for a hormone - driven event   that develops or evolves with a phenotypic change associated with lifestyle .  \ndiet predisposes children from ethnically diverse populations resident in the usa to chronic conditions such as cancer later in life ; this same early - life influence is noted in the uk [ 14 , 15 ] .\nthe question then is whether due to differing environmental and/or lifestyle changes , a phenotypic change occurs in migrants to western regions ( e.g. , northern / western europe and usa ) and their children ( i.e. , the f0/f1 generations ) , and this then not so much enhances vulnerability as a mutation might , but creates accessibility to critical target sites ( e.g. , tumour suppressor genes ( tsgs ) and oncogenes ) in the genome of subsequent generations ( table 1 ) . as a consequence the f2/f3/and so forth generations inherit a structurally vulnerable genome ; this may be to allow increased growth and physicality associated with western lifestyle , but it could also open up the potential for genomic accessibility with consequent cycles of chemical - dna adduct formation and potentially faulty repair .\nthis parental priming of the genome template could be termed a genomic susceptibility organizational structure ( sos ) ; within this model , later generations do not inherit predisposing mutations but a chromatin organization that allows critical genes to be better targeted by dna - damaging agents of environmental and/or dietary origin .  \nenvironmental and/or lifestyle factors alter the epigenome of the f0/f1 generation amongst a migrant population to a high - risk region ; these inherited epigenetic alterations would then predispose the genome of subsequent generations . this hypothesised model would explain why epidemiological studies to date have failed to identify causative factors for breast or prostate cancers although migration , hormone factors , calorie / protein / fat consumption , and exposure to carcinogens have been variously implicated .\nthis review sets out to delineate a potential role for transgenerational epigenetic influences in the aetiology of breast and prostate cancer , cancers arising from these sites being more complex than more directly targeted tissues such as the lung , colon or stomach .\nit will also highlight that conventional epidemiological studies that typically set out to establish cause ( or susceptible genotype ) and effect , will be severely limited in their scope under this paradigm .\nhowever , it also shows why with ever increasingly large studies more robust associations with environmental causes are noted .\nepigenetic alterations include modifications in dna methylation , posttranslational influences on histone morphology / code ( i.e. , proteins forming the nucleosome core of chromatin and pivotal in structural packaging of dna ) , nucleosome positioning and , the profile of micrornas ( mirnas ) and noncoding rnas [ 1618 ] .\nthe most - studied alteration to date is methylation at the 5 position of cytosines mediated by dna methyltransferases ( dnmt ) , predominantly in cytosine - guanine dinucleotide ( cpg ) sites ; this generates 5-methylcytosine ( 5-mec ) , and if it occurs at sites that occupy the promoter regions of genes , this hypermethylation is correlated with transcriptional silencing .  \nmethylation can result in complete transcriptional repression of tsgs such as p16 ; if detected early enough , the specificity of this methylation pattern could be predictive for cancer types occurring at a particular or different sites [ 20 , 21 ] .\nthis has led to the development of quantitative methylation - specific pcr analyses to determine the methylation status of a panel of candidate tsgs in order to determine if one can triage for certain cancers .\nsuch methylation patterns may throw up new differentially expressed gene candidates in cancer , some of which may even be free of mutations .\nthese observations herald the possibility of epigenetic blood - based biomarkers linked to the underlying mechanism of a specific cancer pathogenesis ; it opens up possibilities of novel early screening tools .  \nalthough methylation status is currently the most - studied epigenetic marker , there is increasing recognition that other modifications such as those of the histone code can modify the chromatin organization in such a way as to influence in a dominant fashion regional mutation - rate ; this could be a pivotal observation to be translated to the notion of the evolution of a genomic sos in humans .\nhistone deacetylases are now recognized to play a role in the control of the dna damage responses at several levels .\nwhat is compelling is that these structural chromatin alterations can be inherited ; this remodelled genome must influence the offspring 's susceptibility to damage events following carcinogen exposures in their lifetime , that is , a genomic sos .\nmetabolic signals play a critical role in determining chromatin structure ; thus one can surmise that given a markedly different lifestyle , the same genotype could generate a markedly different phenotype through the evolution of differing profiles of epigenetic marking of the genome .\nwhen migrants arrive in a new region , an initially slowly - adopted diet and/or lifestyle will then impact on the organizational structure and relative compaction of their offspring 's chromatin ( figure 2 ) .\nmigrants from the far east to northern / western europe may see their children / grandchildren grow more than those with similar genotypes in previous generations ; this may be looked upon as a beneficial health outcome , but does this have an impact on the accessibility of their genome to genotoxic exposures of dietary and/or environmental origin ? studies of evolution have suggested that epigenetic drivers have underpinned dramatic changes in developmental biology , an example being that of cognitive function , to a far greater extent than genetic variability\n. persistent physical exercise will modify the epigenome , which will alter phenotype ; likewise , diet and/or lifestyle will undoubtedly play a significant role in this process too .   of additional recent interest\nalthough their biology and function still remain mostly obscure , they are believed to have core functions in a wide range of cellular processes , through interaction with key component proteins in the gene regulatory system .\nalterations of their cell- or tissue - specific expression and/or their primary or secondary structures are thought to promote cell proliferation , invasion , and metastasis .\nmirnas comprise a family of small , endogenous , noncoding functional rna molecules that have emerged as key posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression ; they may again be useful biomarkers for early detection of disease - related molecular and genetic changes .\nnoncoding mirnas can contribute to cancer development and progression , and are differentially expressed in normal tissues compared to cancers ; their expression signature may define cancer gene targets   or be diagnostic of the cancer type .\nhowever , not dissimilar to histone modifications , the expression profile of noncoding mirnas constitutes an epigenetic alteration that seems to regulate male gamete production , cns functions , cell cycle and proliferation , and erythrocyte development during haematopoiesis in vertebrates , amongst a plethora of other biological functions and mechanisms . in a mouse model\n, paternal exposure to the procarcinogen benzo[a]pyrene ( b[a]p ) affected the expression of several mirnas , and the target genes for some of the dysregulated mirnas were enriched in many different pathways that are likely to be relevant for the developing embryo .\nthe notion of an expression control by a posttranslational genomic signature generated by a previous generation 's environmental influence , but governing the offspring 's susceptibility , will pose extreme challenges for future epidemiological studies .\nthis does not represent a simple cause - and - effect model within the individual but one modulated by ancestral environmental influences .\nearly - life ( pre- and/or postnatal ) influences on the epigenome appear to modify risk to later - life susceptibility to chronic diseases , including cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and cancer . in a number of animal models , the maternal nutritional environment appears to play a pivotal role in the long - term wellbeing of the offspring ; we are only now beginning to investigate how this might influence the epidemiology of chronic age - related diseases such as cancer in humans .\ncancer is a heterogeneous disease , which we understand now is not only caused by genetic alterations ( e.g. , mutations ) but also by an altered gene expression profile ( i.e. , epigenetic alteration ) . given that we have known for years about a constitutive role for extrahepatic bioactivating enzymes capable of activating procarcinogens [ 42 , 43 ] , differences in expression between different regions or cell populations within the same tissue , and their environmentally-/lifestyle - mediated modifiable nature , the notion that epigenetic influences may also modify their role in cancer aetiology is not unsurprising .\ndifferences in environmental influences mean that older monozygous twins who may have grown up in differing environments ( e.g. , urban versus rural ) exhibit significant discordance in epigenomic markers such as genomic distribution of 5-mec dna and histone acetylation compared to those examined in the early years of life .\nepigenetic changes in dna methylation patterns at cpg sites ( which could be known as epimutations ) may give rise to transgenerational effects , although understanding these phenomena in real - world situations remains a major challenge .\nhowever , the premise of this review is that a transgenerational step is required towards acquiring the elevated risk of breast or prostate cancer observed in north / western europe and the usa .\nthis differs from a more cause - and - effect model seen with lung cancer induced by tobacco smoke , stomach cancer induced by nitrosamines , or hepatocellular carcinoma induced by aflatoxin b1 .\never since valproic acid was identified as a specific histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitor , it has also been speculated that new intervention or therapeutic strategies exploiting agents that also modify transcriptional regulation in the pathogenesis of cancer via the generation of epigenetic alterations could be developed .\nalthough this may convey a novel therapeutic strategy in the presence of disease , it also raises the possibility that continuous low - level exposures to epimutagenic agents might enhance susceptibility to genotoxic mechanisms . a whole range of chemical contaminants found in the human diet and/or environment may modify the epigenomic patterns of cytosine methylation and/or histone acetylation .\nexamples of this are the heavy metals including arsenic , nickel , chromium , and cadmium , which increase cancer incidence ; these are weak mutagens but appear to be potent modifiers of the epigenome . by examining morphological changes in heterochromatin and dna methylation at gene loci in an in vitro early embryo ( mouse ) model , it was shown that selected environmental contaminants , including diethyl phosphate , mercury , cotinine , selenium , and octachlorodipropyl ether induced at low concentrations ( i.e. , ppb ) , marked and sometimes irreversible epigenetic alterations ; given the potential for real - world exposures to such exogenous agents , one might surmise that this could impact human embryological development .\nof course , humans are not exposed to single test agents but are exposed continuously and variously throughout life to a changing cocktail of different contaminants .\nmodelling the potential effects of such mixtures is a challenge , as different test agents might be similarly acting or independently acting [ 57 , 58 ] ; as such , they could act in combination in additive , synergistic , or inhibitory mechanisms . in populations with high exposures to persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) , such as greenlandic inuit ,\nsuch observations make it highly likely that epigens ( i.e. , modifiers of the epigenome ) found routinely in the human diet and/or environment could modify the human epigenome , which could add another level of complexity in the exposure - causation model of classical epidemiological studies .\nif these heritable genomic alterations are a consequence of parental or early - life exposures , they may if they occur greatly enhance subsequent susceptibility to later - life factors in the aetiology of chronic disease .\nthere is an increasing suggestion in the academic literature that exposure to environmental contaminants may play an aetiological role in a range of disease - predisposing conditions , including obesity .\nalthough high - density calorie diet and lack of physical activity might be the primary causes of obesity , endocrine disruptors acting as obesogens could initiate or exacerbate this morbidity [ 61 , 62 ] .\nin addition to endocrine disruptors , there is a growing body of evidence that heavy metals , including nickel , lead , cadmium , arsenic and others , asbestos , and alcohol intake all act to variously modify the potential for epigenetic alterations .\nair pollution constituents , especially particulate matter ( pm ) , appear to alter the profile of mirnas .\npm is known to alter epigenetic markers ( e.g. , dna methylation and histone modifications ) , which may contribute to air - pollution - mediated health consequences including an elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases or events ; identifying individual epigenetic loci associated with dysregulated gene expression following exposure could generate novel intervention strategies mitigating the development of such adverse outcomes .\nin addition , perfluorinated compounds are of significant concern as they bioaccumulate with suggestions that in utero human exposure is associated with global hypomethylation of the genome ; recently , perfluorooctanoic acid - mediated toxicity was associated with aberrant methylation of glutathione - s - transferase pi , a carcinogen - detoxifying enzyme .  \nchemical pollutants , dietary components , temperature changes , and other external stresses can indeed have long - lasting effects on development , metabolism , and health , sometimes even in generations subsequent to the exposed individual .\na growing body of epidemiological evidence demonstrates associations between parental usage ( especially occupational ) of pesticides , particularly insecticides , giving rise to acute lymphocytic leukaemia and brain tumours in offspring .\naccumulating evidence suggests that environmental and occupational exposures to natural substances , as well as man - made chemical and physical agents , play an aetiological role in human cancer ; carcinogenesis may be induced by either genotoxic or nongenotoxic carcinogens ( e.g. , arsenic , 1,3-butadiene ) that also cause prominent epigenetic changes .\ncadmium is a toxic , nonessential transition metal and contributes a health risk to humans , including strong associations between its exposure and various cancers or cardiovascular diseases .\nthis agent has been shown to induce various epigenetic changes in plant and mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo , and this is likely the primary mechanism via which it mediates its toxicity .  \nthe importance of early - life changes towards future susceptibility to chronic age - related diseases is gaining increasing recognition .\nof major concern in this regard are observations that common environmental contaminants such a bisphenol a and phthalates can variously be hypomethylating and alter mirna expression levels or dnmt activities ; the fact that such agents appear to induce low - dose effects postmaternal exposure in the genital tract of female offspring of mice   suggests a phenotype change associated with an epigenetic alteration that has later - life consequences .\nin fact , in the area of environmental epigenetics , such agents as well as other endocrine disruptors including organochlorines , are likely to play a pivotal role .\nthis could be an important link with cancers arising from hormone - responsive tissues , including the breast and prostate .\ndisruptors of hormonal status via epimutagenic processes are yet to be understood in terms of their long - term health consequences .\nthe interplay between genotoxicity and epigenetic alterations remains to be elucidated ; for instance , acetylation of histones occurs during the process of dna damage induction . as direct - acting dna - damaging agents are traditionally known as genotoxins , agents that induce aberrant epigenetic alterations may be known as epimutagens . in general ,\ncancer is typified by global genomic hypomethylation and site - specific hypermethylation , especially at tsgs : the former being associated with an overactive genome and proliferation , and the latter with inactivation of genes such as tp53 that might sit at the crossroads between induction of aberrant proliferation and apoptosis .\ntime of exposure during life , dose , gender , and organ specificity all need to be considered in the development of epigenetic endpoints as biomarkers for exposure to epimutagenic toxicants .\nhow at different stages of life in a particular target organ there is induction of irreversible changes to the genetic material ( i.e. , dna mutations ) against a backdrop of putatively reversible changes to the epigenetic landscape ( i.e. , changes in the dna methylation and chromatin modification state ) remains to be understood .\ndoes the latter modify accessibility of the genome in a fashion that predisposes it to genotoxic insult ?\nthis may underpin the interplay between genotoxic and epigenetic mechanisms in the aetiology of cancer .\nlinking exposures and their possible effects to environmental health is a major inter - disciplinary challenge .\ninter - individual variability increases with age and is probably mediated by an environmental modification of the epigenome ; this could explain why genetically identical twins might age differently .\nin fact , the ageing process has recently been observed to be associated with an increasing level of global genomic hypomethylation . in lung cancer tissues , several gene loci\nideally , epidemiological studies require early biomarkers of risk so that susceptible individuals and/or populations can be identified . in theory , this would facilitate intervention studies within which damaging exposures would be reduced or removed . because epigenetic alterations are modifiable\n, this has enormous implications for cancer prevention and treatment .   in an era of epidemiology that has been largely based on attempting to correlate gene - environment interactions to identify environmental causative factors imposed on a profile of genetic susceptibility , determining parental or ancestral lifestyle and/or environmental influences on transgenerational susceptibility to chronic diseases such as\npopulations that migrate from regions of low disease incidence to high - risk areas do not just face changes in environment ( which may in fact become more contaminant - free and regulated in the case of westernized regions ) , but primarily , and especially in subsequent generations , profound cultural and lifestyle changes .\nthis has resulted amongst asians migrating to the uk in a higher prevalence of type ii diabetes compared to the multigenerational resident population , obesity and coronary heart disease . within a laboratory model such as the agouti mouse\nhowever , given that human lifestyle has changed so dramatically in the last few generations , especially in northern / western europe and usa , factors that were either potentially deleterious ( e.g. , smoking ) or even beneficial ( e.g. , high calorie storage ; ) may manifest an increased susceptibility or protection in a subsequent generation . understanding ancestral influences on current risk stratification in today 's global population is going to be a major challenge in coming years . the traditional model of cancer causation\nis based on an initiating exposure ( independent of age ) by a genotoxic / mutagenic agent followed by a multistage process of promotion , which may take > 20  yrs in humans [ 87 , 88 ] ; invasive disease characterized by gross genomic instability then progresses beyond this . in the absence of the inheritance of highly - penetrant mutant alleles ( e.g. , brca1/2 )\n, this model has laid the basis for our understanding of the aetiology of sporadic cancers .\nthe need for an initiating exposure was first proposed by roger case in his studies of bladder cancer incidence in dye industry workers [ 89 , 90 ] , and subsequent studies of the role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer [ 91 , 92 ] have been pivotal in the acceptance of this theory . molecular archaeology studies clearly demonstrate that a specific environmental / dietary chemical exposure ( e.g. , aflatoxin b1 ) can induce a particular mutation in localized  hotspots  of critical genes ( e.g. , the tumour suppressor tp53 ) in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 93 , 94 ]\n.   one can now point to several types and classes of physical and chemical environmental and dietary carcinogens , which will with or without a bioactivation step ( the latter required in the case of inert chemicals ) induce a genotoxic event , ultimately giving rise to mutations in target cells .\nthese include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) such as b[a]p , heterocyclic aromatic amines ( haas ) such as 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [ 4,5-b]pyridine ( phip ) , physical agents such as ultraviolet ( uv ) or ionizing radiation , and materials including asbestos fibres [ 98 , 99 ] . with indirect or inert chemical carcinogens , a bioactivation step is required ( mediated primarily by cytochrome p450 mixed function oxidases ( cyps ) , but also by n - acetyltransferases ( nats ) or sulfotransferases ) to generate electrophilic intermediates that then give rise to covalent dna adducts at nucleophilic sites on dna bases , for example , c8 position of deoxyguanosine [ 100 , 101 ] .\nthe generation of base substitution or frameshift mutations then occurs via the inaccurate repair of the adducted template , which has been associated with the replication complex performing a mutagenic bypass of the lesion by a slippage mechanism [ 102 , 103 ] .\nthe question is how does the epigen determine the magnitude of the mutagen or genotoxin effect ?\nchromatin accessibility plays a role in not only regulating cell - type specific gene expression , but also dna repair ; if epigenetic mechanisms determine the accessibility of pivotal genes to electrophilic attack giving rise to dna adducts and to subsequent faulty repair mechanisms , this might be a plausible link between the genotoxic insult and the epigenomic modification governing individual susceptibility to cancer causation .\n, the offspring does not have an inherently susceptible genome in terms of polymorphic differences in a panel of susceptibility genes ( e.g. , bioactivating , dna repair , or detoxification ) , but the structural dimensions of the chromatin facilitate its vulnerability to exogenously- and/or endogenously - derived insults .\nthus the parental or ancestral environment and/or lifestyle generated the evolution of a genomic sos , that is heritable , and predetermines from early life the offspring 's susceptibility to genotoxic carcinogens . within the accessible genome ,\nthere is a greatly elevated chance of the initiation - promotion multistage process of carcinogenesis occurring . before embarking on an epidemiological study ,\nsample size calculations are important to provide evidence that the proposed study is capable of detecting real associations between study factors .\ntraditionally , to know what size of relative risk may be confidently detected with the projected size of the cohort and length of followup , one often determines the adequacy of cohort size at the planning stage of a study .\ndisease epidemiology aiming at identification of carcinogens and quantification of associated risks has always had an apparent low resolving power , with detectable incidence or mortality increments often being orders of magnitude smaller than levels which would be of public concern .\nother drawbacks of disease epidemiology are the long latency times in development of chronic diseases , difficulties in reliably tracking large population cohorts and the influence of confounders .\nbiomarkers such as gene polymorphisms or chemical - dna adducts were through the 1990 's employed as measures to improve cause specificity [ 108110 ] . in the main ,\nthese have proved limited in their ability to generate robust risk associations . with the increasing development of systems\nbiology approaches that generate large and complex datasets , deriving significant associations with chronic conditions such as cancer will become more challenging .\nfor instance , in genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) that aim to identify genetic variants related to diseases by examining the associations between phenotypes and hundreds of thousands of geno - typed markers , new theoretical frameworks are required .  \nchemical - dna adducts do occur in target tissues such as the prostate , although their levels may not correlate with expression levels of bioactivating enzymes .\nto estimate sample size using a simple cause - and - effect model is difficult .\nthe majority of studies have failed to provide robust associations with common complex diseases ; that said increasing sample size dramatically may be capable of achieving this , and these observations have given stimulus to the implementation of biobank studies worldwide .\nhowever , incorporation of a transgenerational component into epidemiology studies could require the incorporation of an uncertainty factor in their design .\nthis could also explain why exceedingly large studies are required to robustly isolate cause and effect against the major confounder of inherited chromatin organization determined by ancestral , environmental , and/or lifestyle factors .\nthe complex interplay between nature ( could be understood as genotype ) and nurture ( understood as lifestyle and/or environment ) has been considered to hamper efforts to specify quantitatively the relative contribution of either to disease causation .\nquestions traditionally addressed would be whether particular polymorphisms in key genes ( e.g. , nat2 ) could be associated with a disease endpoint ( e.g. , bladder cancer ) in chinese subjects exposed to an agent ( e.g. , benzidine ) ; here , there appears to be a protective effect of the slow acetylator genotype .\nalthough individual combinations of polymorphic traits may modify susceptibility to exposures , in the complex disease scenario many studies have failed to show robust risk associations with genotype [ 118120 ] .\nspontaneous deamination of 5-mec to thymidine ( which is not excised or repaired ) could be a significant source of signature mutations   in particular cancers .\nthese ct transitions at cpg sites appear to be prevalent mutations in tp53 in human colon cancer . in the context of this hypothesis\n, the question might be whether the definition of an epimutagen could be expanded not just to include altering the methylome , histone code , or profile of noncoding rnas , but also the altering of the accessibility of important regions of the chromatin to genotoxic insult .   as lifetime exposures to environmental carcinogens\nmight be expected to increase risk , especially in genotypes perceived as vulnerable , for example , glutathione - s - transferase null , other lifestyle factors such as consumption of fruit and vegetables appear to be protective against risk of disease [ 124 , 125 ] and even initial dna damage .\nhowever , with the emergence of the epigenomics field the role of modifiable factors takes on another dimension .\none could surmise under the model hypothesized here that environmental and/or lifestyle factors typically associated with a western region might induce the evolution of a genomic sos .\nhowever , are there risk factors such as tobacco smoke or infection that potentiate or accelerate this and thus greatly increase the accessibility of chromatin in future generations to genotoxic insult ?\nconversely , are there protective factors such as healthy intakes of fresh fruit and vegetables that counteract these effects and retard the evolution of the genomic sos ? within epidemiology , deciphering the role of transgenerational influences mediated by epigenetic marking of the chromatin may require a detailed human epigenome project [ 127129 ] . this could allow a stratification of predisposing early - life risk based on the structural organization of the inherited genome and the expression pattern therein . given the even more individualized nature of the epigenome compared to the genome ( it being the genome modified by environment )\nwithin this context it will be interesting to determine whether the epigenome of an individual is relatively similar across all tissues or whether there are between - organ and within - organ differences in the epigenomic profile . for years\nthere has been evidence of a field effect in cancer in which the surrounding tissue might provide the microenvironment allowing the cancerous growth .\nthis has been associated with nuclear changes ( possibly epigenetic ) and downstream epigenetic - associated events including changes in gene and protein expression , dna damage , and angiogenesis .\nthus in prostate , the androgen receptor promotes growth of cancer initiating cells via autonomous signalling pathways , whereas there is a lack and no apparent need for androgen receptor signalling in surrounding stroma . the question would be whether there are differing epigenomic profiles even within the same tissue , some which may generate a field change necessary to nurture the promotion and progression of disease , and others necessary for the clonal expansion of an initiated cell(s ) .\nadditionally , there is emerging interest in exosomes , which are extracellular subnanosized vesicles that are believed to contain defined patterns of mrna , mirna , noncoding rna , and occasionally genomic dna .\nthis may be a relatively unexplored mechanism of intercellular communication in which transferred genetic information may induce transient or persistent phenotypic changes in recipient cells .\nexosomes play a fundamental biological role in the regulation of normal physiological as well as aberrant pathological processes , via altered gene regulatory networks and/or via epigenetic programming ; how they may modulate the microenvironmental epigenome remains to be ascertained . in the past ,\ncorrelations of environmental exposure and cytogenetic biomarkers have been very complex   because of the interaction of independent factors ( e.g. , genotype versus exposure ) . often within each factor\n, there will be a requirement to stratify for variables such as age or gender .\nhow such a variable could be readily factored into large - scale epidemiological studies is uncertain . in general\none relies on biological material that is readily available , including blood ( whole serum or plasma ) , buccal mucosa , or urine .\ncirculating free dna in plasma has often been used . whether epigenetic alterations in surrogate tissues such as peripheral blood lymphocytes correlate with exposures ( ancestral versus present ) and can reflect disease risk or development in a target tissue remains to be determined . as more regions\nbecome increasingly westernized in their lifestyle , based on the genomic sos model , one could surmise that the environmental and/or dietary influences are already occurring in the present generation in traditionally low - risk regions of china , india , or japan ; this will predispose the next generations to higher incidences of breast and prostate cancer .\nfigure 1(a ) shows that incidence of colorectal cancer in japan is now not dissimilar to levels observed in northern / western europe or the usa , the former being traditionally a low - risk region for this disease .\nhowever , levels of breast or prostate cancer still remain relatively low in this region ; that said , are epigenetic modifications already occurring that in the next decades will predispose this population to markedly higher levels of this disease ?\nthis transgenerational switch in chromatin accessibility could be a dichotomous marker to the offspring 's commitment to an elevated risk .\nthe development of robust and high - throughput sensor platforms examining the in situ methylation status or genomic sos may be far off .\ndespite an overwhelming amount of epidemiological evidence pointing to a role for environment and/or lifestyle in the aetiology of breast and prostate cancer , the failure to identify causative factors has led some to question this in favour of endogenous entities , for example , reactive oxygen species and hormones .\nhowever , how ancestral exposures may influence the accessibility and consequent susceptibility of an individual 's genome remains to be understood .\nthis transgenerational influence may not be applicable in all cancers ( e.g. , lung , colorectal , or stomach ) in which there might be more direct applications of the causative agent(s ) ( e.g. , tobacco smoke constituents , haas , or nitrosamines ) to the target site .\nas a consequence , such cancers exhibit a faster rate of increasing or decreasing incidence in migrant populations from low-/high - risk regions .   the additional generation gap between migration from a low - risk region and attaining an incidence of breast or prostate cancer similar to the host populations points to a transgenerational step .\nthe hypothesis laid out herein is that in the f0/f1 generations there occurs an evolution towards a genomic sos , a model within which the chromatin becomes more accessible for genotoxic insult ( figure 2 ) .\nthis organizational structure of the chromatin is inherited and could be considered an epimutagenic event lending increased susceptibility to the organism and preceding mutagenic events incurred via environment and/or lifestyle factors by the f2/f3 generations .\nsuch a model could partially explain why traditional epidemiological studies have in the main failed to draw firm cause - and - effect conclusions .\na combination of novel sensor technologies and epigenetic biomarkers will be needed to order to integrate ancestral epigenetic influences at the organism , organ , and within - organ levels into future studies designed to give insights into the aetiology of these cancers .\nif ancestral influences such as environment and/or lifestyle markedly influence susceptibility to chronic diseases such as sporadic breast or prostate cancer , this will have enormous social as well as biological implications ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " epidemiological studies have consistently supported the notion that environmental and/or dietary factors play a central role in the aetiology of cancers of the breast and prostate . however , for more than five decades investigators have failed to identify a single cause - and - effect factor , which could be implicated ; identification of a causative entity would allow the implementation of an intervention strategy in at - risk populations . \n this suggests a more complex pathoaetiology for these cancer sites , compared to others . when one examines the increases or decreases in incidence of specific cancers amongst migrant populations , it is notable that disease arising in colon or stomach requires one or at most two generations to exhibit a change in incidence to match that of high - incidence regions , whereas for breast or prostate cancer , at least three generations are required . \n this generational threshold could suggest a requirement for nonmutation - driven epigenetic alterations in the f0/f1 generations ( parental / offspring adopting a more westernized lifestyle ) , which then predisposes the inherited genome of subsequent generations to mutagenic / genotoxic alterations leading to the development of sporadic cancer in these target sites . \n as such , individual susceptibility to carcinogen insult would not be based per se on polymorphisms in activating / detoxifying / repair enzymes , but on elevated accessibility of crucial target genes ( e.g. , oncogenes , tumour suppressor genes ) or hotspots therein to mutation events . this could be termed a genomic susceptibility organizational structure ( sos ) . \n several exposures including alcohol and heavy metals are epigens ( i.e. , modifiers of the epigenome ) , whereas others are mutagenic / genotoxic , for example , heterocyclic aromatic amines ; humans are continuously and variously exposed to mixtures of these agents . \n within such a transgenerational multistage model of cancer development , determining the interaction between epigenetic modification to generate a genomic sos and genotoxic insult will facilitate a new level of understanding in the aetiology of cancer .

considering the age range of our sample ( 1336  years ) , this result was similar to ours . a number of crosssectional studies have demonstrated that imt increases with advancing age,21 , 24 which is consistent with our results even after adjustment for the other cv risk factors over time .\nas in the young finn study , sex differences in the imt were mostly explained by differences in risk factors and vessel size.21 in line with previous findings imt increased with increasing bmi,25 and childhood ses played a significant role early in the atherosclerotic disease process.26 , 27 , 28 \n  contrary to numerous previous studies we did not find an association between imt and exercise , smoking , and alcohol drinking.29 , 30 , 31 , 32 consistent with our result , the association between smoking status and imt has been reported by sass and colleagues in middleaged but not in young adults.8 the short smoking duration in the younger population may be 1 possible reason to explain this paradox .\nseveral studies have reported an association between systolic bp and imt in a middleaged population,10 , 33 but some studies in children and young adults have not found such an association.8 , 10 we also did not find an association between blood pressure and imt in the present study .\nthis discrepancy may be due to differences in study protocols ( eg , age range of study cohort and portion of the carotid artery that is studied).8 , 10 , 34 \n  interestingly , we found a faster increase in the mean imt on the left side than that on the right side .\nkollias and colleagues reported that the leftside imt was higher and more closely related to cv risk factors ( mainly systolic bp ) than that on the right side in children.35 several other studies also demonstrated that imt is higher on the left side than the right side in middleaged or older populations.36 , 37 these results were consistent with our study to some extent .\natherosclerotic processes at different artery segments are a result of differing mechanisms associated with the specific structure .\nthe artery segments differ in geometry , cellular composition , and function and are exposed differently to shear stress.38 , 39 hernandez and colleagues found a higher left imt than right imt in untreated hypertensive patients , and this finding has been attributed to the higher crosssectional area of the intimamedia complex and higher flow velocity at the left side.14 our results suggest that changes in the leftside imt might be better indicators of atherosclerotic processes in young adults . whether the observed differences reflect a natural course of adaptive vascular injury on different shear stress conditions requires further study .\nfirst , our cohort just included black and white americans , and the results may not be generalizable to other populations .\nsecond , imt was measured only in the common carotid artery , making it difficult to compare with other studies using different segments of the carotid artery . here\nwe consistently scanned the common carotid artery , and it is possible that including the carotid bifurcation and the internal carotid artery may enhance the prediction of atherosclerotic disease.40 third , we only have 3 visit measurements , and not all participants were measured 3 times in our study ;

response model ) for evaluating risks to the human genome , led to the adoption of the lnt model for cancer risk assessment .\nit states that the probability of the number of cancer deaths is proportional to the collective radiation dose of a population ( clarke and valentin 2005 ) . for the lung tumor data ( spontaneously - occurring plus radiation - induced ) in fig .\n4 of fisher and weller ( 2010 ) , the lnt model would predict about 5 tumors in the 26 dogs that were exposed to a cumulative alpha - radiation dose in the range 8 to 48 cgy .\nthe observed incidence of 0 tumors in the 16 dogs in the 8 to 22 cgy range and 1 tumor in the 10 dogs in the 27 to 48 cgy range suggests a beneficial effect , but the lnt statistical variations of these low tumor observations are too large to challenge the lnt prediction of 5 tumors .\nhowever , the overall shape of the dose - response data shown in figures fig . 1 to fig .\nfurthermore , severe molecular damage , including many double - strand dna breaks , occurs locally around each plutonium particle in tissue .\nthese breaks are caused by the alpha radiation with its dense ionization , i.e. , high let , over a distance of several cell diameters . since cancer is associated with dna mutations , tumors are predicted at these locations .\nconsidering the spontaneously - occurring lung tumors , it is quite surprising that only one tumor was observed among the 26 dogs that were exposed to cumulative lung absorbed doses in the range 8 to 48 cgy . at these doses\nall cells are hit at least once by an alpha - particle ( simmons and richards 2010 ) .\nthe data and the biology conform to the lack of increased lung cancer in people living in houses with elevated radon concentration ( hall and giaccia 2005 ) and contradict the lnt prediction that the probability of radiation - induced cancer is proportional to dose .\nthere is a large amount of data from a wide variety of medical treatments with radiation at doses below 100 cgy , including treatments for serious infections , and many radiobiological studies , all carried out over the past 120 years .\neven lower doses or lower level dose - rates , predominantly below 20 cgy , can up - regulate adaptive protection systems in terms of delayed and temporary detoxification , dna - repair , and damage removal in various ways ( cuttler 2013 , 2014 ) .\nsuch exposures have been shown to remove spontaneously - occurring cancer cells induced by endogenous effects and also remove radiation - induced damage .\nfor example , oncologist k. sakamoto observed the total removal of tumors in all regions of the body , probably by induction of protective mechanisms , of a patient with advanced ovarian cancer , after treatment with 15 whole - body doses of only 10 cgy x - rays , over a 5 week period ( sakamoto 2004 ) .\nthe biological phenomenon that results from adaptive protection is radiation hormesis ( feinendegen et al .\nthis model predicts a reduction in the overall incidence of lung tumors , as a consequence of stimulation of protection by low level radiation .\nthe fisher and weller ( 2010 ) data comply with these expectations . in the lowest range , from 8 to 22 cgy , no tumors were observed .\n3 indicates a strong rise in the incidence of tumors , as the cumulative dose increases , which flattens starting at about 500 cgy .\nas shown in fig.4 , the noael ( no observed adverse effects level ) is about 100 cgy .\n( radiation pneumonitis is the cause of death following exposures above 3000 cgy . ) in challenging the lnt theory , fisher and weller ( 2010 ) also point to the measured lifespan dose -

borne diseases that result in significant crop losses and damage to natural ecosystems .\nbayoud is a vascular wilt caused by fusarium oxysporum f. sp . albedinis ( foa ) , and it is the most serious fungal disease threatening date palm plantations in north africa , especially in morocco .\nresistance to the pathogen is found only in a few cultivars of date palm , which unfortunately produce poor - quality fruit . a promising strategy for reducing diseases\nplant defence mechanisms are represented by a number of structural and biochemical changes such as phytoalexin synthesis , callose deposition , cell wall lignification , and pathogenesis - related ( pr ) proteins induction .\nhowever , these reactions do not always correlate with disease prevention . among others , salicylic acid ( sa )\nalthough the mechanism of sa - mediated plant defence is not completely understood in all crops , its central role in plant defence is well established [ 68 ] .\naccumulation of sa has been shown to be crucial for the expression of pr proteins   which have antimicrobial activity and thought to be involved in plant resistance . among them , peroxidases were described in plant defence against both necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens .\nperoxidases can generate a physical barrier to prevent the penetration of the pathogen into the host tissues ; it catalyzes the h2o2-dependent crosslinking of cell wall components leading to cell wall lignification . in the date\npalm - foa pathosystem , the first report confirming the involvement of sa in plant defence was by dihazi et al . , who showed that application of sa activated the metabolism of phenolic compounds and induced the biosynthesis of some hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives then described as sinapic acid derivatives .\nflavonoids are also detected in plant cell walls in interactions with a resistance outcome , and their concentration increased significantly in clover roots in response to infection with pythium ultimum . in the date\npalm - foa pathosystem , flavonoids have been described in the roots by ziouti et al .   and were correlated to date palm callus defence against foa .\ngiven the complexity of the root system of date palm plants , it is difficult to understand the role of the above - noted defence responses without a microscopic analysis of their effects in situ .\ntherefore , the objective of the present paper was to contribute a cytological investigation to studies on the mechanisms involved in sa - induced defence reactions .\nwe investigated both structural and biochemical changes involved in conferring resistance to date palm cultivar jihel against foa after treatment with sa .\nthese included induced phenolics ( i.e. , flavonoids ) as well as induced activity of peroxidase . furthermore , an ultrastructural analysis was carried out with the aim to elucidate the role of sa in events involved in resistance of date palm towards foa .\nwe used 6-month - old date palm seedlings obtained from seeds produced by cultivar jihel , highly susceptible to foa wilt .\nthey were grown in a greenhouse ( 16  h photoperiod ) and then inoculated by injecting 10  l of foa conidial suspension ( 6  10 sporesml ) into the roots .\nseedlings were treated with sa ( 100  m ) by soaking their roots in an sa solution three days before infiltration with the inocula .\ntwo groups of treated plants were considered , inoculated ( ti ) and uninoculated ( tu ) .\ncontrol treatments were untreated inoculated ( ui ) and untreated uninoculated ( uu ) plants .\nplant material was collected , 15 days after inoculation , from areas with necrotic lesions when disease symptoms became visible .\nroots were fixed overnight at 4  1c in a solution of 2% glutaraldehyde , 2% paraformaldehyde , 1% caffeine , and 0.2  m phosphate buffer ( ph 7.2 ) .\ntissues were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in resin ( technovit7100 ) .\nsections ( 3  m ) were double - stained in periodic acid - schiff ( pas ) reagent and naphthol blue - black ( nbb ) .\nsoluble and reserve proteins were specifically stained in dark blue with nbb   and pas stains starch reserves and cell walls pink .\nsections from date palm root tissues were fixed for 1 hour in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.2  m potassium phosphate buffer ph 7.2 .\nstaining was done by incubation of the sections in tris - hcl buffer 0.05  m , ph 7.6 containing 1.4  10  m diaminobenzidine ( dab ) , 2% h2o2 ( 1% ) , and 10  m 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole .\nsds - page of peroxidases was carried out using acrylamide - bisacrylamide ( 300.8 ) gels as described by baaziz .\nenzyme extraction was conducted with potassium phosphate buffer ( ph 7.2 ) containing 4% polyvinylpyrrolidone .\nfor each treatment , root tissues ( 200  mg fresh weight ) of three seedlings were collected from areas with necrotic lesions and then homogenized in 1  ml of the buffer solution .\nthe homogenate was centrifuged at 10  000  g for 30  min , and the supernatant was used as the enzyme extract .\nelectrophoretic separation was carried out at constant current of 60  ma for 2 -

square test for goodness of fit ( spss statistics 17,0 ) .\nboth sa - treated and nontreated plants were inoculated with fusarium oxysporum f. sp . albedinis to determine their susceptibility to fungal attack .\ntypical disease symptoms , mainly characterized by the formation of enlarged brownish lesions at the sites of fungal contact , were visible by 15  d after inoculation ( d.a.i . ) in control plants .\nin contrast , with 100  m sa resulted in much less disease development than in nontreated date palm plants .\ntreated inoculated plants generally developed limited necrotic lesions , which reflected a delay in the colonization of the host plant by the pathogen ( figure 1 ) .\nobservations of transversally sectioned root samples from nontreated plants that were inoculated with foa showed that all tissues were massively invaded by the pathogen except for the sclerenchyma , which was seldom colonized .\nroot tissues were intensely colonized as evidenced by the presence of pathogen hyphae through the cortex , the endodermis , and the vascular stele .\nhistochemical analysis confirmed the expression of induced proteins in sa - treated plants inoculated or uninoculated with foa ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) .\nthe proteins ( stained in dark blue with nbb ) were strongly expressed at the cell layer surrounding the xylem vessels and in some parenchyma cells near the endodermis .\nperoxidase activity revealed by brown deposits after dab staining was noted in sa - treated plants both inoculated ( 85% ) and uninoculated ( 60% ) with foa and also in untreated inoculated ones ( 70% ) .\nsuch activity was localized in the cell walls and in the intercellular spaces of both the cortical parenchyma cells and the phloem tissues ( figures 3(b ) , 3(c ) , and 3(d ) ) . in roots from control plants ,\nin addition , sds - page analysis ( figure 4 ) confirmed this result ; in foa - infected plants two peroxidases isozymes with mm values of 150 and 142  kd were markedly expressed .\nthese isozymes are present in trace amounts in untreated uninoculated plants and clearly decrease both in sa - treated and in sa - treated and inoculated ones .\ninterestingly , two additional isozymes with mm values of 32 and 28  kd were expressed only in sa - treated and inoculated plants and suggested that the activation of peroxidase with sa was more pronounced in infected plants .  \npalm root controls treated with the neu 's reagent , a greenish yellow fluorescence was observed under blue light in sclerenchyma , endodermis , and vascular parenchyma cell walls .\nwhen plants were inoculated with foa , a decrease in this specific fluorescence was observed and a brownish color appeared in cells located near the xylem vessels ( figure 5(b ) ) . when plants were treated with sa and challenged by foa ,\nflavonoids were induced ( 75% ) ( bright orange fluorescence ) in the vascular - parenchyma cell walls near the xylem vessels ( figure 5(d ) ) , probably at sites of potential pathogen penetration . their presence\nclose examination of infected roots ' ultrastructure showed that pathogen ingress toward the vascular stele coincided with extensive vascular disorganization and marked cell alterations of the cytoplasm which was frequently reduced to vesicular remnants ( figure 6(d ) ) .\nthe colonization was characterized by a marked deterioration of the cell walls resulting in its complete dissolution ( figure 6(c ) ) as compared to the preserved cell walls in uninoculated roots ( figure 6(a ) ) . in all cases ,\nthe observed pattern of fungal colonization and host cell disorganization coincided with the occurrence of macroscopically visible symptoms along the roots , leading to severe plant wilting and eventually plant death .\nfungal growth was mainly intracellular , but it could also occur intercellularly through direct host wall penetration . the germ - tube attempts to cross the host cell walls occurred preferably through the plasmodesmata at pit fields lacking secondary wall material ( figures 6(b ) and 6(h ) ) .\nin sa - treated plants , the colonization by foa differed markedly from that observed in control plants .\nfungal growth was reduced , and hyphae were seldom seen in the tissues of the host roots .\none of the most striking changes observed in sa - treated plants as compared with controls was the elaboration of several host defence reactions that included the deposition of an electron - dense material closely associated with the cell walls ( figure 6(f ) ) .\nthis material forms a coat in the vessel lumen ( figure 6(g ) ) and at sites of intercellular spaces leading to plug them ( figure 6(e ) ) and eventually to alter the invading hyphae ( figure 6(h ) ) .\nwall appositions were also observed at sites of pathogen invasion ( figure 6(f ) ) .\nthese structures were associated with fungal cell walls ' distortion , breakdown of the plasma membrane , and an apparent densification of the cytoplasm ( figure 6(h ) ) .\nthey are probably meant to strengthen the host cell walls and to prevent the pathogen from spreading .\nwe have previously described the role of sa in enhancing the survival of foa - infected date palm plants by triggering the synthesis of new phenolic compounds   which were identified as hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives [ 13 , 25 ] .\ntreatment to our knowledge , this is the first report showing the effects of sa on the cytochemical changes of the root tissues in the date palm - foa interaction .\nthese results suggest that sa induced protein synthesis in both inoculated and uninoculated plants , especially in the cell layer surrounding the xylem vessels and also in vascular parenchyma cells located near the endodermis and in some cortical parenchyma cell walls .\nthe proteins induced in response to sa treatment were strongly expressed in asymptomatic date palm plants and could play a role in resistance . in nontreated inoculated plants ,\nthese proteins were present , but not enough to stop the spreading of the pathogen and several signs of tissue alterations were noted . in agreement with earlier studies\n, the present results confirmed that defence reactions in sa - treated plants were more pronounced after fungal challenge .\nmoreover , we have shown that both sa - treated plants and the infected ones have expressed high peroxidase activity , with two isozymes ( 150 and 142  kd ) in inoculated plants that disappear in sa - treated ones and two new isozymes ( 32 and 28  kd ) expressed only in sa - treated and inoculated plants .\nthe expression of these new isozymes only in inoculated and sa - treated plants may constitute a sort of  priming  of date palm plants toward its pathogen .\nthis corroborates other findings that correlated date palm resistance against foa with peroxidase activity [ 2628 ] . indeed ,\njaiti et al .   had shown that jasmonic acid increased the peroxidase activity in date palm plants after foa infection .\nperoxidases are frequently responsive to sa or jasmonic acid , and it is widely known that they play a central role in host plant defences against pathogens .\nperoxidases may be involved in the peroxidation of substrate molecules , leading to the accumulation of highly toxic compounds , which may contribute to resistance via their antifungal potential .\ninterestingly , a high peroxidase activity was detected in the phenolic - storing cells , especially in sa - treated date palm roots .\nfurthermore , salicylic acid is known to repress some jasmonic acid pathway - related defence mechanisms [ 31 , 32 ] .\nthis may explain the presence of isozymes in inoculated plants then their absence after sa treatment .\nwhy some isoforms of peroxidase are induced while others are repressed remains to be determined .\nin addition , histochemical analysis showed that flavonoids accumulated only in sa - treated and foa - inoculated plants and filled the vascular parenchyma cell walls .\nthis confirms the implication of sa in sensitizing date palm plants to respond faster to its pathogen .\nthese phenolics are different from those revealed in date palm root controls which were caffeic acid derivatives .\nflavonoids were considered as important phenolic compounds detected in plant cell walls in resistant interactions .\ntheir accumulation has occurred only in the resistant cotton variety inoculated with the pathogen xanthomonas axonopodis pv .\nmore recently , carlsen et al .   have shown that the concentrations of flavonoids formononetin and daidzein increased significantly in clover roots in response to infection with pythium ultimum .\ndixon   confirmed the antimicrobial action of flavonoids during plant - fungal pathogen defence responses .\nmcnally et al . , using the podosphaera xanthii - cucumber interaction , have also localized the production of c - glycosyl flavonoids in resistant plants .\nmore recently , el hadrami et al .   have shown the involvement of rutin in the interaction between potato and verticillium dahliae . in the date\npalm - foa pathosystem , flavonoids have been detected in trace amounts in date palm roots   and have been suggested to play a role in date palm callus defence against foa , but none of the previously published studies has reported the involvement of sa in triggering the accumulation of flavonoids related to date palm plant defence .\nour data suggest that flavonoids were expressed after sa treatment in the cell walls of vascular parenchyma cells closely associated with the xylem vessels especially in tissues around the necrotic zone and this is associated with plant resistance .\nhave reported that the necrosis formations may come from the action of peroxidase on flavonoids during the lignification process . to investigate whether the observed biochemical changes correlate with the structural modifications ,\ndate palm root tissues were examined at the ultrastructural level . in nontreated date palm plants ,\npathogen ingress into the vascular stele was characterized by severe host cell alterations , including cell wall degradation and alteration of the cytoplasm , which was frequently reduced to vesicular remnants .\nthis may suggest that the fungus produces cell wall hydrolytic enzymes that hydrolyze host components and lead to fungal spread into the root tissues .\nsuch enzymes were previously described in date palm - foa interaction and were correlated to disease development .\nthe protection against foa in sa - treated date palm plants was associated with a deposition of an electron - dense material , a wall apposition in host cells , and an increase in damaged fungal cells .\nthis electron - dense material was closely associated with intercellular spaces , known to be strategic sites for pathogen spread .\nsuch host reactions , obviously designed to halt pathogen ingress , were never seen in control plants .\nfungal cells , near these electron - dense materials , were frequently disorganized , suggesting a fungitoxic environment generated by this material .\nthe nature of this material is not yet determined . its reactivity to osmium tetraoxide indicates that these compounds are possibly of phenolic nature .\nthe accumulation of phenolic compounds in the host cell walls may contribute to enhancing the mechanical strength of these defensive barriers . according to our cytochemical observations ,\nthe electron - dense material formed in sa - treated root tissues could include flavonoids .\ninterestingly , in banana roots attacked by the nematode radopholus similis , electron - dense materials have been associated with the impregnation of cell walls by flavonoids previously detected by histochemical analysis .\nthe nature of the wall apposition formed after sa treatment is also not yet determined , but their involvement in pathogen attack was demonstrated since fungal cells near these wall appositions were altered .\nseveral reports indicated that wall appositions contain callose and cellulose , as revealed by cytochemical analysis .\nthey provide evidence that sa treatment induces structural and biochemical changes in date palm roots in response to fungal infection .\ncortical and vascular - parenchyma cells are the main cells involved in sa - induced response leading to the accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds , as well as the induction of new isomers of peroxidase .\nthis confirms the possible implication of sa in triggering date palm defence against its pathogen and confers a promising strategy for effective control of the bayoud disease ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " histochemical and ultrastructural analyses were carried out to assess structural and biochemical changes in date palm roots pretreated with salicylic acid ( sa ) then inoculated with fusarium oxysporum f. sp . \n albedinis ( foa ) . \n flavonoids , induced proteins , and peroxidase activity were revealed in root tissues of sa -

ips , 6% ; p < 0.001 ) .\nmoreover , studies have suggested that hypotension , raynaud 's phenomenon , and migraine are related to primary vascular dysregulation .\nprimary vascular dysregulation has been known to cause unstable ocular perfusion and act as a strong pathogenic mechanism of glaucoma . in this study , reported hypotension , migraine , and raynaud 's phenomenon were found in higher frequency in the ics group than in the ips group ( p < 0.001 , p = 0.003 , p = 0.001 , respectively ) . additionally , snoring is a sign of sleep apnea , which has been reported to be a vascular dysregulatory risk factor for glaucoma .\nthe higher prevalence of glaucoma , especially ntg , in patients with sleep apnea may be due to decreased ocular blood flow during sleep apnea . in this study\n, we found that the reported snoring was significantly more frequent among patients with ics than in patients with ips ( p = 0.001 ) .\nthus , based on the comparison of non - iop - related risk factors , we found that vascular dysregulatory factors were more commonly reported in patients with ics when compared with ips .\nthe previous studies have reported a possible connection between smoking and glaucoma with conflicting results .\nwilson et al . , exploring the relationship between smoking and oag , found a positive association of smoking with oag .\nother studies of similar nature , however , could not find smoking to be associated with oag , nor with increased iops . regarding obesity ,\nobesity seems not to be a risk factor for glaucoma by some , but bmi has been reported to be inversely related to oag by others .\nalso , another study has reported that a patient with higher bmi has a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with glaucoma . in the singapore malay eye study\n, it was reported that higher bmi patients show small cup - disc ratios , and this suggests a protective effect of high bmi on oag .\nhowever , it is still unclear whether obesity may increase or decrease the likelihood of glaucoma .\ntherefore , this study was designed to determine whether lifestyle related risk factors , such as smoking or obesity , were associated with ics in ntg patients . however\n, our results did not reveal a clear relationship among smoking , obesity and characteristics of vfds .\nalthough these findings coincided with those of previous studies , our results are based on a relatively small sampling of ntg patients and the results can not be considered conclusive . in this study ,\nthis suggests that central field defects are of a more localized nature when compared with peripheral field defects .\nrecently , cho et al .   demonstrated that there are no differences in the clinical characteristics between ics and ips groups , except for the initial vf index and occurrence of superior hemifield ; prevalence of dh , hypotension , migraine , and raynaud 's phenomenon are not significantly different between the two groups .\nthese discrepancies seem to arise from the different characteristics of the two study groups , which are the follow - up period and the number of patients .\nthe follow - up period of the study was more than 7 years , but that of the present study was about 2 years , which is a relatively short period compared with the previous study .\nmoreover , the total number of patients in the study was 66 and the total in this study was 159 . an additional long - term follow - up study is needed to compare the results .\nthis study has some shortcomings due to the retrospective nature of its design and the relatively small number of patients .\nalso , data regarding the prevalence of systemic risk factors were collected from the questionnaire survey , which is subject to error , ignorance and recall bias .\nfuture large - scale prospective case - control studies are needed to validate the results of this study . in conclusion , this study found that ntg patients with ics had a distinctive set of vascular risk factors , such as reported systemic hypotension , migraine , raynaud 's phenomenon , and self - reported snoring when compared to the patients with ips .\nawareness of the relationship between vascular risk factors and ics may be useful in managing patients with ntg .\nbecause patients with ics may be at a greater risk of losing sight , ntg patients with systemic vascular factors or dh should be followed more carefully .\nfurther study is needed to elucidate the relationship between the non - iop vascular pathogenesis and initial vf characteristics ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " purposeto investigate the risk factors for initial central scotoma ( ics ) compared with initial peripheral scotoma ( ips ) in normal - tension glaucoma ( ntg).methodsfifty - six ntg patients ( 56 eyes ) with an ics and 103 ntg patients ( 103 eyes ) with an ips were included . retrospectively \n , the differences were assessed between the two groups for baseline characteristics , ocular factors , systemic factors , and lifestyle factors . \n also , the mean deviation of visual field was compared between the two groups.resultspatients from both ics and ips groups were of similar age , gender , family history of glaucoma , and follow - up periods . \n frequency of disc hemorrhage was significantly higher among patients with ics than in patients with ips . \n moreover , systemic risk factors such as hypotension , migraine , raynaud 's phenomenon , and snoring were more prevalent in the ics group than in the ips group . there were no statistical differences in lifestyle risk factors such as smoking or body mass index . \n pattern standard deviation was significantly greater in the ics group than in the ips group , but the mean deviation was similar between the two groups.conclusionsntg patients with ics and ips have different profiles of risk factors and clinical characteristics . \n this suggests that the pattern of initial visual field loss may be useful to identify patients at higher risk of central field loss .

conversely , almost all sle patients evaluated in the present analysis are caucasian .\nmoreover , we analyzed the group of sle patients persistently negative for anti - dsdna , identifying a significantly higher frequency of serositis compared to the anti - dsdna positive patients .\ndata from the literature describe serositis as a frequent sle manifestation , especially as pericarditis ( 848% of patients ) and pleurisy ( 3045% ) . in our analysis ,\nthe frequency of serositis in persistently anti - dsdna negative patients resulted higher than 80% .\nseveral authors have reported the association between serositis and positivity for anti - ssa / ssb antibodies , unconfirmed in our cohort [ 7 , 24 ] .\ncertainly , a limit to consider is the relatively small number of patients in this group ( 96 subjects ) , determining caution in the interpretation of the results . in the light of the features of this group , a better analysis , by assessing larger population , could be very attractive in order to characterize these sle patients and to modify some aspect strictly related to the positivity for anti - dsdna .\nfor example , biological drugs , such as belimumab , could be prescribed exclusively in patients with positivity for anti - dsdna , considering active disease only in these patients .\nsle is a multifactorial disease in which genetic and environmental factors interplay , determining disease development [ 2 , 25 , 26 ] .\nthe genetic background could explain not only the disease susceptibility but also the autoantibodies production .\nthe genome - wide association study , conducted by chung and colleagues in 2011 , demonstrated that many previously identified sle - associated genes are more strongly associated with the production of anti - dsdna than with disease susceptibility .\nthe authors demonstrated the association between polymorphisms ( snps ) located in the mhc , stat4 , irf5 , and itgam regions and the positivity for anti - dsdna antibodies .\nconversely , only snps in the mhc and irf5 regions have been identified in negative patients .\nfinally , for the first time the present study analyzed a peculiar group of sle patients , those with initial positivity and subsequent negativity of anti - dsdna .\nfirstly , the only clinical and laboratory difference identified in patients who become negative for anti - dsdna compared to persistently positive patients was a lower frequency of renal involvement .\nmoreover , the modification of autoantibodies status was not associated with a change in disease activity , as demonstrated by the absence of significant difference in the mean eclam values before and after the status change .\nwe have chosen to assess disease activity by eclam , because this index does not include the anti - dsdna determination among the items evaluated , unlike other disease activity indices such as sle disease activity ( sledai ) .\nthis observation is reinforced by the evaluation of the therapeutical strategies adopted in this group of patients after the modifications of the anti - dsdna status .\nalmost half of the patients maintained the same treatment and 17.3% required the introduction of a new immunosuppressant drug .\ntaken together these results suggest that the presence of anti - dsdna is associated with a specific subset of disease with peculiar clinical and laboratory features , which do not change when anti - dsdna become negative , maintaining similar aspect also in terms of disease activity . on the contrary\n, the persistently anti - dsdna negative status seems to identify another subset of patients , with peculiar clinical features , in particular serositis ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " \n objectives . \n the anti - dsdna antibodies are a marker for systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) and 7098% of patients test positive . \n we evaluated the demographic , clinical , laboratory , and therapeutical features of a monocentric sle cohort according to the anti - dsdna status . \n methods . \n we identified three groups : anti - dsdna + ( persistent positivity ) ;

grade pc ( or = 0.68 , 95%ci 0.351.34 ) and a positive association with low - grade disease ( or = 1.42 , 95%ci = 0.812.47 ) .\nin contrast , high vitamin b12 intake associations with both hg pc and lg pc were not statistically significant .\nthe only significant observation was that high intake of methionine was associated with increased pc risk ( or = 2.1 , 95%ci 1.13.9 , p = 0.02 ) , when compared to intake 2.6  g / day .\nthese associations were somewhat stronger for low - grade pc ( or = 2.8 , 95%ci 1.35.7 , p = 0.007 ) .\nwhile of lower magnitude than for low - grade disease , these associations were in a similar direction for high - grade disease ( or = 1.44 , 95%ci 0.583.54 , p = 0.43 ) .\nthese patterns of association were similar in african americans and whites ( data not shown ) .  \nthe frequency of these genotypes in controls were similar to those in hapmap where minor allele frequency ( tt ) was 8% and ct frequency was 31% for 677ct , and minor allele frequency ( cc ) was 7% and ac frequency was 37% for the 1298 snp . in pc cases , 66% were homozygous for the mthfr c677 t wild - type allele\n cc  , versus 35% that carried either 677ct ( 24% ) or 677tt ( 11% ) . in controls ,\n54% were homozygous for the c677 t wild - type allele ( cc ) , and 46% were either homozygous ( tt : 37% ) or heterozygous ( ct : 9% ) carriers of the mthfr variant ; these variants were in hwe ( p = 0.27 ) .\nsixty - six percent of pc cases were wild type for the a1298c variant , and 35% carried the heterozygous ( 1298ac : 31% ) or homozygous ( 1298cc : 4% ) variant .\nfifty - three percent of the controls were homozygous for the a1298c wild - type allele ( aa ) , and 47% were either homozygous ( cc : 6% ) or heterozygous ( ca : 41% ) carriers of the mthfr variant , and they did not deviate from hwe ( p = 0.41 ) .\nwe observed no significant association between carrying the mthfr c677 t ( or = 0.7 , 95%ci 0.31.3 ) or mthfr a1298c ( or = 0.70 , 95%ci 0.371.33 , p = 0.28 ) and pc risk ( table 3 ) . to further evaluate the interaction of high methionine intake and pc risk association by mthfr genotypes , we measure or and 95%ci in pc cases .\nthe association between higher methionine intake and pc risk did not vary significantly by mthfr c677 t genotype ( table 4 ) .\nhowever , we observed considerable variation between methionine intake and pc risk in carriers of mthfr a1298c ( or = 6.7 , 95%ci 1.627.8 ) compared to noncarriers ( or = 1.0 , 95%ci = 0.23.9 ) .\nthe cross - product term for mthfr a1298c and methionine was statistically significant ( p = 0.045 ) .\nthus , high methionine intake association with pc risk seems to be linked to the mthfr a1298c polymorphism in this population .\n  our key findings were that high intake of methionine , which after its conversion to s - adenosylmethionine becomes the principal methyl donor for dna methylation , was associated with higher overall risk of pc and that association was only evident in men with carriers of the mthfr a1298c genotype .\nassociations between b vitamins and pc risk were unremarkable and inconsistent and not modified by mthfr genotypes .\nour findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excessive intake of a key one - carbon cycle nutrient may be associated with pc risk , particularly in carriers of the mthfr a1298c genotype .\nthis increased pc risk is possibly due to acceleration of growth of preexisting neoplasms , though these results require validation in other and larger datasets .  \nmechanisms by which higher methionine intake could increase pc risk remain speculative . although these results could have been due to chance alone , methionine is the key player in the one - carbon metabolism cycle as after conversion to s - adenosylmethionine it becomes the principal methyl donor for dna methylation , an epigenetic phenomenon associated with cancer .\nour findings that high methionine intakes were associated with increased pc risk , may imply that methionine availability at higher than optimal levels may lead to higher bioavailability of s - adenosylmethionine to donate methyl groups to dna , resulting in dna hypermethylation of regulatory regions of key genes , including tumor suppressors .\nfor example , hypermethylation of the cpg promoter sequences of tumor suppressor genes and the gstp - p1 ( glutathione - s - transferase ) gene is the most frequent alteration in pc cells and may be associated with prostatic tumorigenesis .\nalternatively , higher bioavailable methionine levels could also disrupt the physiologic equilibrium concentrations of s - adenosylmethionine and homocysteine , reducing mthfr activity [ 43 , 44 ] , and thus induce genome - wide hypomethylation , a hallmark of cancer .\nin addition to higher dietary intakes , methionine can also be regenerated if more circulating 5-methyl thf is available to remethylate homocysteine to methionine , which may be the case when folate intake is high .\nhowever , > 700  mcg / day of folate intake through diet and supplements have a weak inverse association with pc risk , as reported by others , as well as vitamin b6 taken at higher than recommended levels , though these were not seen in the current study . together\n, our findings suggest that the driver in the one - carbon metabolism pathway in diseased pc tissues may be methionine and not folate and that previous inconsistent findings in relation to folate intake or in circulation and higher pc risk could be attributed to cohorts in which methionine metabolism is impaired [ 5 , 46 ] , though of course this is purely speculative and future larger studies are needed to confirm our findings .  \nwe found no evidence for an association between mthfr gene variants and pc risk , consistent with findings from others .\ncarriers heterozygous for c677 t have a 35% reduction of mthfr activity while homozygous c677c carriers have 70% less mthfr enzymatic activity .\nthe c677 t variant lies in the catalytic domain at the nh2-terminal region of the protein , while the a1298c variant lies on the regulatory domain of the mthfr enzyme , at the cooh - terminal region of the protein , where s - adenosyl - methionine binds , allosterically inhibiting mthfr . in our study\n, higher intakes of methionine reported by pc cases may further diminish mthfr function , which would diminish availability of 5-methyl thf to remethylate homocysteine into methionine , which in turn may cause homocysteine accumulation , an effect that has been associated with adenocarcinomas of the breast and ovary [ 56 , 57 ] .  \nassociations between pc risk and higher intakes of folate , vitamin b6 , and vitamin b12 were not evident .\nalthough we can not rule out the possibility that our null associations could have been due to a limited sample size , confirming these findings in a larger study will be important .\nulrich et al .   observed an increased colorectal adenoma risk in individuals with lower intakes of folate and b - vitamins , particularly in elder populations ( over 60  yr old ) , suggesting that age may modify the association between folate and cancer risk .\nour findings showed that higher intakes of vitamin b12 , a cofactor in the reaction of methionine synthase to regenerate methionine from homocysteine , was unrelated to pc risk in contrast to a prior study , which showed increased overall pc risk .\ntogether , our results could indicate that methionine metabolism may be impaired in older men who develop pc , and that consuming higher intakes of methionine may aggravate this impairment .\nthis effect could be even more pronounced in individuals carrying the mthfr a1298c genetic variant .\nfuture research is needed to understand the underlying mechanism for these associations , while more studies are needed to determine whether the effect of high dietary methionine would cause methylation alterations .  \nthe main limitation of this study is the small sample size and consequent inability to adequately evaluate the role of common variants in the mthfr , which limited our ability for stratified analyses by pc grade .\nalso , the small sample size leads to concerns about type i errors for our significant findings and type ii errors for our null observations . in this study ,\nafrican americans were at higher risk for pc in general , though race / ethnic - specific analyses would benefit by larger sample size . another limitation is that dietary intake does not account for metabolized nutrients , and circulating levels of nutrients involved in the one - carbon metabolism pathway were not measured and neither were the upstream markers for homocysteine levels .\nalso , results should be interpreted and framed as  among screeners  since all cases and controls have had a psa test in the past 12 months ; thus it would be uncertain how these findings would relate to populations with lower frequency of psa testing , since diet quality ( and one - carbon nutrient intake ) may be related to screening behaviors .\nhowever , this study provides early data in support of the provocative hypothesis that excessive intake of one carbon cycle nutrients [ 29 , 30 ] may be associated with increased pc risk .\nwe provide novel evidence for increased pc risk in relation to high intake of methionine as a function of mthfr a12986c genotype .\n  in summary , our results suggest that higher intakes of methionine , presumably through higher protein consumption , is associated with increased pc risk , regardless of grade of lesion , but only in men carrying the polymorphism mthfr a1298c ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " prostate cancer ( pc ) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men . \n recent reports suggest that excess of nutrients involved in the one -

families ( collagens \n and mapk related serine - threonine protein kinases ) were detected ( figure 2 ) .\nsimilar to pathways enriched with genes showing \n a microcystis  genotype interaction , the expression \n of the genes in these few pathways and gene - families was studied more \n in depth by means of reaction norm plots ( supporting \n information figure s10 ) . at the organismal level , \n\nno genotypic differences in mixture response \n were detected ( i.e. , no genotype  cadmium  microcystis interaction ; supporting information table \n s1 ) .\nhowever , a limited number of genes , that is , 1.5% of the putative \n genes on the array , showed a 3-way interaction ( contrast no . 7 ; table 1 ) . of these 430 genes , 188 and 77\ngenes also showed \n a main genotype response or main microcystis response , \n respectively .\nforty - three of these genes showed both a main genotype \n and microcystis effect ( supporting \n information figure s8 ) .\nnone of the genes showing a three - way \n interaction overlapped with genes showing a cadmium main response \n ( supporting information figure s8 ) .\none \n pathway , the ribosome pathway , was enriched with members of this gene \n set ( figure 2 ) .\ntwo gene - families were enriched \n with members of these genes showing a three - way interaction .\nboth \n were related to transcription and translation processes and did not \n overlap with gene families enriched with genes showing one of the \n main effects ( figure 2 ) .\nreaction norm plots \n showed an influence of the genotype on the significant genes in the \n cadmium  microcystis interaction ( supporting information figures s11s13 ) .\nthe present study shows the possibilities \n and limitations of implementing \n an environmental genomics approach that takes into account genetic \n and environmental variation to better understand the response of natural \n populations to stress .\nthe methods we present allow for characterizing \n the effects of multiple stressors on genome - wide transcription and \n the response of biological pathways and gene - families , for isolating \n the genotype - dependent response to single - stressors , for defining \n interaction effects of mixtures at the transcription - level , and for \n assessing if the nature of mixture interactions varies across genetic \n background .\nour results for each of these effects are discussed in \n terms of application to adverse outcome pathways ( aop ) or risk - based \n predictions of stressors effects in natural populations .\naops represent \n a sequence of events that begins with a molecular initiating event , \n spans multiple levels of biological organization and ends with an \n adverse or toxic outcome at the whole - organism level .\nthe application of transcriptomics data to an aop approach \n has \n predominantly been used to interrogate acute exposures to single stressors , but in the current study the \n transcriptome response to single stressors did not always correlate \n with higher - level effects ( i.e. , growth and reproduction ) .\nmolecular \n approaches , such as microarrays , are typically used to study perturbations \n in molecular toxicity pathways .\nuse of \n this information within an aop framework should ultimately lead to \n predictions of effects at higher biological levels , which are currently \n still more useful in ecological risk assessment .\nhowever , our study demonstrates that this response relationship \n is not always clear - cut .\nfor example , cadmium elicited an adverse \n effect on both reproduction and growth in one genotype , yet a negligible \n effect of the stressor on gene - expression was observed ( only 9 differentially \n expressed genes ) .\nalthough our analysis was quite stringent by applying \n a significance cutoff of p < 0.01 , this conclusion \n was still maintained when a less stringent cutoff of p < 0.05 was applied ( table s6 in supportive \n information ) .\nour observed results differ from the literature \n where robust gene - expression changes following acute exposure ( i.e. , \n 24 to 96 h ) to cadmium have been reported , and these genes could be coupled with some known \n mechanisms of action of and response pathways to cadmium . however , our studies measured gene transcription after chronic ( i.e. , \n several days ) exposures to sublethal cadmium concentrations to better \n reflect the ecological realities of cadmium exposures in natural environments .\nmore complex regulatory pathways such as those \n resulting in acclimation have been reported following these longer - duration \n exposures .\nspecific detoxification mechanisms , such as metallothionein ( mt ) \n proteins , have an important role in the defense against cadmium toxicity .\nhowever , these mts , and other genes , are often expressed in a time - dependent \n manner .\nasselman et al . , for instance , showed a significant response of the four mt genes \n in d. pulex exposed to cadmium after two to eight \n days , but not after 16 days of exposure .\nthis may be due to the long \n turnover time of mts causing a discrepancy between gene expression \n and protein levels .\nsuch dynamic processes could explain why transcriptomic \n responses may not always correlate with higher - level responses for \n all exposure levels or durations .\nin contrast to cadmium , transcriptomic \n patterns in response to microcystis stress did show \n a complexity that mirrored results \n at the organismal level . in this case\n, the gene - expression patterns \n revealed that reduction in reproductivity and growth was a result \n of several different mechanisms , such as the lack of essential nutrients \n ( e.g. , essential fatty acids or lipids ) , or the presence of feeding \n deterrents and toxins , or oxidative stress . the mechanisms revealed \n by the transcriptional response agree with previous results at both \n the transcriptomic and organismal level .\nthus , combining the results obtained for the cadmium and the microcystis exposure , we show that the ability of transcriptomic \n profiles to predict higher - level effects is dependent on the stressor \n and exposure conditions under consideration .\nanother potential \n benefit of gene - expression data is to disentangle \n the variability of the environments in which natural populations reside . \n indeed , using conventional toxicity assays with limited apical end \n points , it is difficult to assess the complexities of natural environments \n that include exposure to stressor mixtures beyond their directional \n influences on toxicity ( i.e. , greater or less than additive ) . for \n example , gene - expression profiles provide a more detailed biological \n understanding of the mechanisms by which mixture components interact . \n\nthese data allow interactions to be assessed with greater knowledge \n than the phenotypes of , for instance , reproduction or growth by identifying \n pathways and gene - families that drive interactions .\nthe transcriptomic \n response to multiple stressors has been studied \n before in daphnia , but there is a clear difference \n between all these studies and our present study in the way these responses \n are analyzed and interpreted .\nthe previous studies have compared the \n recorded transcriptomic response to mixtures against responses to \n individual stressors , but have not formally evaluated interactive \n effects between the stressors . yet , interactions \n between multiple stressors , regardless of whether they occur at the \n gene - expression , physiological , individual or population level can \n only be judged against an appropriate baseline of additivity . by joining well - established mixture toxicity baseline models with \n gene - expression data the current limitation of providing mainly anecdotal \n evidence on mixture effects at the transcriptomic level may be overcome . the present study is to our knowledge the first \n to investigate mixture interactions with transcriptome data using \n the independent action ( ia ) reference model , which is typically used \n to set the baseline for mixture interactions between unrelated stressors .\nthe interaction responses of expressed genes \n identified in our study provided insight into the biological meaning \n of mixture interactions .\nfor example , the ubiquinone biosynthesis \n pathway was the only pathway significantly enriched with expressed \n genes showing a cadmium  microcystis interaction \n effect .\nubiquinone functions as an electron - carrier in the electron \n transport chain in mitochondria , and \n because its electrons are only loosely bound when ubiquinone is in \n a reduced state , it has been suggested to play an important role as \n an antioxidant in the oxidative stress response in daphnia .\ngene - families enriched with expressed \n genes showing a cadmium  microcystis interaction \n effect were mapk related serine - threonine protein kinases and collagens \n of type iv and xiii .\nmitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapk ) are \n serine - threonine protein kinases that are expressed in all eukaryotic \n cells and that are activated by diverse stimuli ranging from cytokines , \n growth factors , neurotransmitters , hormones , cellular stress , and \n cell adherence .\nmapk pathways have been \n previously reported to be involved in nutrient deprivation and responses \n to stress stimuli such as osmolarity changes .\nnutrient deprivation is most likely , as discussed above , a consequence \n of the lack of essential fatty acids in microcystis , while osmolarity changes may be a consequence of oxidative stress .\nseveral endogenous \n immunostimulatory peptides in insects that may serve as danger and \n alarm signals are derived from collagen type iv .\nalthough no interaction between cadmium and microcystis was observed with apical end points , these studies demonstrate the \n potential use of gene - expression patterns to better understand interactions \n occurring in stressor mixtures .\nin addition to mixture interactions , \n transcriptome data can also \n dissect variation introduced by the diversity residing within natural \n populations .\nin other words , these methods have the potential to disentangle \n the sources of variation that give rise to the most central tenet \n in ecotoxicology , the dose  response relationship . in the current study ,\ndifferences between the \n genotypes are reflected both at the organismal and the gene expression \n level .\npathways and gene - families enriched with expressed genes that \n show a microcystis  genotype interaction effect \n are not differentially regulated following microcystis exposure in the cadmium tolerant genotype , but are in the sensitive \n genotype .\nthis observation could suggest that genes involved in tolerance \n mechanisms to microcystis stress already have the \n basal expression level needed to cope with the stress in the tolerant \n genotype .\nthe reaction norm approach provided in the current study \n provides a method for visualizing this hypothesis .\nindeed , this hypothesis \n is only valid if genes in the sensitive genotype following microcystis exposure reach the same expression level as \n that of the constitutively expressed genes in the tolerant genotype . \n\nbased on the reaction norms , this was clearly not case for the majority \n of the genes ( figure 3 ; supporting information figure s9 ) .\nother mechanisms must thus \n be at play , for example those preventing that microcystis can exert its toxicity in the cell , to explain why the tolerant \n genotype shows little to no effects of microcystis exposure both at the organismal and the transcriptomic level .\nfirst , \n this tolerance could be acquired by limiting internal , cellular exposure \n to microcystis .\nmeasurements of internal microcystin \n concentrations , which were significantly lower in the tolerant genotype , \n provide added support for such a mechanism .\nsecond , the observation \n of a microcystis  genotype interaction for \n genes encoding trypsins and neurexins , suggests a role of these gene - families \n in the genotypic difference in tolerance to microcystis stress .\na previous study has reported both up- and downregulated \n genes encoding for trypsins in d. pulex following microcystis exposure .\nthese \n authors argued that this up- and downregulation is in accordance with \n the observations by agrawal et al . and \n\nschwarzenberger et al . who noted differential \n sensitivity of trypsins to microcystis , both at the \n rna and the protein level .\nspeculated that trypsin isoforms , which are more sensitive to microcystis were downregulated while less sensitive isoforms \n were upregulated .\nour data show a very different set of differentially \n expressed trypsin genes between the sensitive and the tolerant genotype \n and therefore identify those isoforms that can be considered candidate \n isoforms that may correlate with tolerance differences and that could \n be an interesting subject of more detailed future studies ( figure 3 ) .\nhowever , the function of neurexin in daphnia and \n its role in response to microcystis stress remains \n unclear .\ninterestingly , the trypsin gene - family is also enriched with \n genes showing a main microcystis effect indicating \n that some members of this gene family respond similarly to microcystis stress across both genotypes , underscoring the \n potential power of gene - expression data to accurately disentangle \n genotypic differences in tolerance . understanding the mechanisms that \n account for tolerance difference highlight the fact that these transcriptomic \n methods can provide ecologically important insights .\nfirst , the cadmium tolerant \n genotype proved to be also more tolerant to microcystis at the organismal level , while the cadmium sensitive genotype was \n more sensitive to microcystis stress ( i.e. , decreased \n reproduction after microcystis exposure compared \n to a control ) .\nsecond , the cadmium tolerant genotype showed , compared \n to the sensitive genotype , only few differentially expressed genes \n in the pathways and gene - families that were enriched with genes showing \n a microcystis  genotype interaction effect . \n\nthese observations strongly suggest that the cadmium tolerant genotype , \n originating from a historically , metal polluted environment , is better \n armed to deal with microcystis stress .\nmoreover , \n the common toxicity mechanisms between cadmium and microcystis that we hypothesized to be the armory for interactions between these \n two stressors , indeed provided the arms that enable the cadmium tolerant \n genotype to also better cope with microcystis stress . \n\npathways and gene - families related to oxidative stress , food quality \n and the digestive system were enriched in significantly genes that \n segregated the two genotypes .\nsuch pleiotropy , when a gene or pathway \n affects more than one trait , has been previously described as a mechanism \n that can provide  cross - tolerances  between different \n stressors .\nour experimental design \n also allows us to interpret part of the \n complexity of stress responses in a natural environment , that is , \n the genotypic - dependent response to stressor mixtures .\nonly a limited \n number of pathways and gene - families were significantly enriched with \n genes showing a cadmium  microcystis  \n genotype interaction effect .\nthese included the ribosome pathway and \n the histone 2a and 60s ribosomal protein gene - families .\ninterestingly , \n all of these pathways and gene - families are related to transcription \n and translation processes , which suggest a general stress response \n likely to protect proteins .\nin addition , our reaction norm approach revealed in more detail \n genotypic differences in mixture interaction response : cadmium altered \n the gene - expression of genes responding to microcystis stress more pronouncedly in the sensitive genotype than in the tolerant \n genotype\n. overall , our results demonstrate the utility and also \n highlight \n some limitations of applying environmental genomics approaches to \n dissect the complexity of natural environments and the diversity of \n natural populations . we were able to interrogate the effects of mixture \n components and genotypes both independently and in combination , and \n identify interactions responses among gene families and pathways that \n ultimately contributed to tolerance differences between individuals . \n however , these approaches were less successful at linking gene - expression \n results under exposures to single compounds to organismal level responses . \n\nfuture studies should examine more single stressors and also more \n ( and also more complicated ) mixtures across a range of genotypes to \n better define the limits of complexity that these approaches can dissect . \n\nthis will help to further reveal the possibilities and limitations \n of these techniques to dissect more complex environmentally relevant \n exposure scenarios in an aop framework ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the \n present study investigated the possibilities and limitations \n of implementing a genome -

waste has been identified as a major challenge facing humanity today .\ncurrently , around 21,000 people die every day due to hunger related causes   and globally one in nine people go to bed each night hungry . nevertheless , approximately one - third of all food produced today goes to landfill .\nthe vast amount of food ending up as waste is not only a humanitarian problem , but also a serious economic and environmental problem [ 57 ] .\nthe world has limited natural resources and environmental benign cost - effective solutions must be found to increase food production , improve distribution networks , and promote effective food supply chain management practices . to alleviate the increasing demand for food production ,\nreducing food waste is an important factor that can significantly improve the overall efficiency of the food supply chain .\nresearchers in the field maintain that sustainable food production , intelligent management , and proper food distribution are the key factors that must be addressed if we expect to feed the predicted 12.3 billion people in 2100 [ 7 , 9 ] .\nso , reducing food waste becomes a priority , since waste will continue to be generated throughout the food supply chain if no action is taken .\ncompanies involved in the food supply chain and the population at large will continue to waste food as long as they can afford to waste .\nimportantly , food waste results in loss of time , effort , and the other resources that went into producing that food .\nother resources lost include fertilizers , pesticides , and the soil and water . from an environmental perspective\n, food lost or discarded each year accounts for 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions globally .\nthe scale of food waste globally can be quite staggering and several significant examples are presented in table 1 so that the reader can appreciate the magnitude of the problem .\nthus , governments , industry , and communities must work collaboratively to achieve policy and cultural change towards prevention of food waste at all levels [ 10 , 11 ] .\ntherefore , to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for food , it is essential to adopt a policy that says  no  to food waste .\ndefining food waste is not always straightforward since distinguishing between edible and nonedible parts of food is subjective . in some parts of the world\nnaturally , not every part of an agricultural or livestock product is entirely edible and there will always be unavoidable nonedible parts such as citrus fruit zest , fruit stones , bones , and eggshells [ 12 , 13 ] . in many cases , the difference between edible and nonedible is not clearly defined and depends on dietary habits ( consumption of bread crusts , apple or potato peel , fat on meat , etc . ) , food culture , and geographic location . in the present study , food that is not consumed by the end user , which includes the nonedible parts of the food ,\nall food products go through a life cycle , starting from the farm and progressing through processing , distribution , retail , and finally consumption and/or dumping as presented in table 2 .\nthe degree of food waste depends on factors such as ( 1 ) developed and developing country [ 6 , 14 ] ; ( 2 ) prevailing weather conditions and pest management protocols ; ( 3 ) storage , transport facilities , and processing efficiency [ 1618 ] ; ( 4 ) market demand and visual appearance of produce ; ( 5 ) consumer acceptance of produce   and consumer affordability to waste .\neven a couple of decades ago , food waste was not considered to be a significant economic cost or a waste of natural resources . however , growing public concerns about hunger , conserving the environment , and the effect of socioeconomic factors have accelerated research into food waste .\nfood waste research is aimed at finding better ways of using this natural and renewable resource .\nunfortunately , there will always be a certain amount of waste produced in the food supply chain .\nhowever , current levels of waste occurring in the food supply chain are much greater than other industries and arise from the lack of willingness or inability to coordinate the various activities along the chain [ 2123 ] .\ntherefore , to make the food supply chain more sustainable and effectively manage food waste , a much deeper understanding of the current state of affairs is needed .\nthis not only means food waste itself , but also means taking into account associated factors like greenhouse gas emissions ( ghg ) and the use of other resources such as water , land , labour , money , and energy . after taking all these factors into consideration , it is also very important to make the various stages in the food supply chain such as production , distribution , and marketing more efficient and sustainable .\ngenerally speaking , the literature in the field often reports the importance of effective food waste management to reduce problems such as large waste volumes going to landfill , landfill gas emissions , landfill leakage contaminating waterways , and costs associated with transport and handling of wastes .\nalternatively , many food wastes can be considered as a valuable source of nutrients with the potential to be processed into products to feed the world 's increasing population [ 14 , 26 ] .\nrecently , mirabella et al . reported a range of nutrients available from fruit , vegetable , dairy , and meat and fish wastes that could be used in food products ( gelling agent in confectionary , fat replacement in meat products , supplementary food products , and seafood flavours for soups ) and beverage preservatives .\nfood wastes have also been considered as a source of renewable energy with the potential to significantly reduce the current dependency on energy derived from fossil fuels [ 27 , 28 ] .\nusing food waste as an alternative energy source has the advantage of reducing the amount of waste going to landfill and diminishing the associated problems of gas emissions and groundwater contamination [ 29 , 30 ] .\nthe use of food waste also alleviates the problem of land competition between food crops and crops for liquid biofuels .\nthe present review provides an overview of current research into terrestrial and aquatic food waste and progress towards utilising the waste .\nthe review examines the various causes that result in food waste and also presents information regarding waste levels throughout the different stages in food supply chains operating in several regions around the world .\nalso discussed are the socioeconomic aspects of food waste , the willingness to implement food waste initiatives that promote efficient and sustainable food chain management practices .\nin addition , probable future trends and initiatives for the implementation of effective ecofriendly and sustainable approaches for managing food wastes are outlined .\ncrop waste begins at the farm and continues throughout the food supply chain . between farm and fork ,\nfood waste is produced by each of the six stages of the food chain as detailed in table 2 . in developed countries\nfood waste can result from factors such as produce sizing and aesthetic standards , produce quality regulations , production surpluses , and economic factors .\nfor example , in 2009 , italian agricultural produce estimated to be 17.7 million tonnes was left in the ground and equated to around 3.25% of total produce production .\nsurprisingly , some studies have indicated that the agrofood sector waste could be as large as 40% of the total production value , while studies in the netherlands have revealed that annual food wastage costs are around  4.4 billion ( us$ 4.9 billion ) .\nend - consumers waste around  2.4 billion ( us$ 2.7 billion ) or about 10% of all food purchased and the remaining  2 billion ( us$ 2.21 billion ) was wasted through the various stages of the food supply chain [ 33 , 34 ] . in a swedish study ,\n16 different horticultural products including typical fruits and vegetables sold by retailers were responsible for wastes ranging from 0.4% to 6.3% of produce .\nsimilar studies have also found that fruits and vegetables are the main source of household food waste and equate to around one - third of purchased food products .\nfor instance , in the united kingdom ( uk ) , potatoes came first in a ranking of 100 fruits and vegetables and accounted for around 0.4 million tonnes ( 10% ) of total waste produced annually .\naustralians , for example , throw away around au$ 1.1 billion ( us$ 0.84 billion ) worth of fruits and vegetables each year making them the largest food waste category .\nstudies have shown that fruits and vegetables are the most wasted food category among all terrestrial and aquatic food products in both developed and developing countries as seen in table 3 .\nmoisture content , temperature sensitivity , and delicate surface membranes make fruits and vegetables susceptible to spoilage during production , transportation , and storage .\nfor example , in switzerland , around 47% of all vegetables produced are wasted in the food supply chain . and\nin germany fruits and vegetables account for 43% of all household waste as seen in table 3 . in many cases ,\nthe results of these studies are not comparable , since they did not assess the whole food supply chain ( only looked at specific stages and waste types ) and were carried out by different researchers worldwide using different assessment protocols .\nfor example , a number studies on fruit and vegetable waste fail to take into account grains and root / tuber wastes . and\nothers have taken into account wastes generated from grains and root / tubers in an attempt to minimise and simplify data collection .\nmany consumer and retail waste assessments contain very little information about farm practices , processing waste , and wastes resulting from storage and transportation . in spite of their importance ,\nconsumers and retailers can not be considered as the only contributors to waste in the food supply chain .\nnevertheless , it is extremely difficult to obtain detailed information from all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain because of business confidentiality considerations .\nanother limitation arises from the types of measurement procedures used to record and analyse food waste data around the world .\nin addition , making comparisons is difficult because waste levels can be presented in terms of percentage waste , local currency , and even weight loss .\nfurthermore , variations can occur between different regions within a country where economic , social , and behavioural reasons may promote specific types of food wastage .\ndetermining waste levels in a food supply chain often reveals that they are high and costly .\nfor example , in 2008 , the united states of america ( usa ) produced three large waste streams consisting of grain ( us$ 34,791 million ) , vegetables ( us$ 103,417 million ) , and fruits ( us$ 62,146 million ) at considerable economic cost .\nfurthermore , each year , the usa produces more than 2.7 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables that are not harvested or remain unsold due to poor crop aesthetics and low market prices . moreover , most studies only measure or estimate a particular food waste and fail to address any trends in the levels of wastage .\nto remedy this situation , the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) carried out a detailed analysis to understand the variation in food waste levels between 1995 and 2010 .\nthis data is presented in table 4 and shows a downward drift in consumer waste compared to retailers waste , although consumers are often blamed for high waste levels .\nalso , over this period , retail waste has increased for most commodities especially grain products , while consumer waste levels have significantly decreased for some food products such as grain products and fruits . in particular , vegetable waste produced by consumers in 2008 and 2010 was significantly lower than waste levels recorded in 1995 . for developing countries , around 15 to 50% of all fruit and vegetable waste\nfor example , in africa , cassava wastes can be as large as 45%   and yam waste levels can reach 50% . in the philippines , fruit wastes from crops such as\nsimilarly , around 18 to 40% of all fresh fruits and vegetables go to waste in india every year due to the lack of refrigerated transport and high quality cold storage facilities .\nthis equates to an annual cost to food manufacturers and sellers of around us$ 71,481 million .\nunfortunately , much of this data comes from studies carried out almost 40 years ago and because no recent studies have been carried out there is no current assessment of crop waste levels .\nthus , there is a critical need for follow - up studies that take into account factors such as technological innovation , population growth , and consumer and marketing trends .\nit is critical for researchers to document current food waste levels so that stakeholders such as growers , processors , transporters , retailers , and consumers can take steps to address this growing global problem .\nthe second major food group after fruit and vegetables is grain . among the grains ,\nrice is recognised as the world 's second staple food and on average has a waste level equivalent to 15% of total global production [ 44 , 45 ] . however , this waste level is not the same for all countries due to variations in climatic zones and various production practices in each respective country .\nin particular , storage practices in both developing and less developed countries have been extensively studied and reveal significant differences between countries . for example\n, grain storage waste levels range from less than 1% in malawi [ 46 , 47 ] to 12 to 13% in bangladesh and 3 to 6% in malaysia   as seen in figure 1 .\nstudies have also shown that grain waste in the chinese supply chain is 19.0%   5.8% , with consumers accounting for the single largest portion of the waste ( 7.3%   4.8% ) . and\npostharvest and preprocessing cereal waste in sub - saharan africa was estimated to be around us$ 4 billion .\nthis extremely large cost equates to 13.5% of the total cereal production produced by countries in this region .\ninadequate storage capacity , poorly distributed warehouses , lack of adequately designed storage facilities , and inefficient transport and handling management lead to waste levels of around 20 to 30% of india 's total grain production .\nthis level of grain waste is estimated to cost around us$ 14 billion each year and is the highest in the region as seen in figure 1 . amazingly , this level of waste has the potential to provide the minimum annual food requirements of at least 48 million people in india . in pakistan ,\ngrain waste accounts for around 16% of total production , or 3.2 million tonnes annually , and results from inadequate storage infrastructure that permits widespread rodent infestation .\ncurrent data indicates that global postharvest crop wastes have direct consequences in terms of food security , malnutrition , and poverty . except for malawi , an african country reporting low grain waste levels ,\nother eastern and southern regional african countries have reported waste levels equivalent to around us$ 11 billion or 13.5% of total grain production .\nunfortunately , there is very little information available reporting grain wastes in central or west african regions .\nmost grain waste reports do record total percentage waste for each country but do not give individual crop wastes such as maize , rice , wheat , and barley . because these reports do not provide individual information on specific grain crops , it is difficult to determine which are more prone to waste . in spite of this\n, it is evident that policy , political management , natural calamities , storage , infrastructure facilities , and transportation are the main drivers for producing grain waste in developing countries .\nfood waste not only costs money , but also consumes other resources such as land , water , energy , and labour .\nwhen it comes to water usage , south africa 's ( sa ) food waste costs become significant since it is one of the world ' driest countries .\nfor example , approximately 30% of sa 's crop production depends directly on irrigated water , while fruit and vegetable production consumes around 90% of all irrigated water used .\nthe total cost of food waste in sa each year is estimated to be around us$ 5.27 billion and equates to 2.1% of the country 's gross domestic product ( gdp ) . furthermore\n, agricultural production is more prone to waste than processing , packaging , and consumers .  \nfigure 2 presents a comparison between food waste quantities and the food waste costs for each stage in the sa food supply chain .\nthis suggests that both stages are not cost - effective and rather prone to wastage . while consumer waste levels are relatively low , distribution and infrastructure waste levels are relatively high .\nthe results of this study clearly indicate the severity of waste levels within the sa food supply chain .\ngrain waste studies have mainly focused on developing countries , with very few studies reporting grain waste in developed countries .\na small number of studies conducted in the usa have only investigated grain waste in the retail and consumer stages of the food supply chain as presented in table 5 [ 13 , 5860 ] . it should be noted that in most developed countries grains are considered as livestock feed rather than human food .\nthus , there is a crucial need to undertake grain waste studies in developed countries and determine the alternative utilisation of grain and grain wastes as livestock feed .\nthus , the lack of reliable food waste data from around the world and the increasing importance of food security mean that significant efforts are needed to fill in the knowledge gaps .\nsome studies have just recorded food waste levels , while others have also highlighted methods for managing wastes .\nthere are numerous reports in the literature discussing various recycling and utilisation methods available for processing fruit , vegetable , and grain wastes .\nthe aim of food waste utilisation is to extract the maximum practical benefits and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill .\nalthough there has been extensive information discussing various waste recycling strategies for dealing with agricultural waste , there is very little information assessing the economic benefits of the various waste utilisation methods . at present , there are very few reports available discussing the utilisation of agrowastes on a commercial scale and methods to overcome barriers that currently prevent effective food waste management strategies .\nfruit and vegetable wastes including peels , stones , and fibres contain a wide range of natural compounds , while grain wastes derived from straw , bagasse , cobs , cotton husk , groundnut husks , and fibrous remnants of forage grasses are mainly composed of useful materials such as cellulose , hemicelluloses , and lignin .\narguably , grain wastes are the most abundant agricultural wastes and the most underutilised . on the whole crop wastes\nand currently there is a high demand for pharmaceutical ingredients such as enzymes , solvents , and surfactants all of which can be derived from crop wastes . because of the rich source of natural compounds found in crop wastes , the european union , usa , canada , japan , and malaysia are ambitiously developing and promoting an ecofriendly biologically based market .\nfor example , in 2010 , the usa placed a replacement target of 12% on all of its chemical feedstock and by 2030 it is expected that bio - based products will have a market share of around 25% . at present , only a small number of bio - based compounds derived from crop sources have made it into commercial products .\ntypical examples include ( 1 ) succinic acid from crops like sugarcane , maize , rice , barley , and potato ; ( 2 ) starch based plastic production from cassava , maize , and wheat ; ( 3 ) surfactants from tropical oil producing grains ; ( 4 ) fatty acids from coconut and oil palm ; ( 5 ) polymers , lubricants , adhesives , solvents , and surfactants from rapeseed and sunflower ; and ( 6 ) lactic acid from carbohydrate containing crops such as cereals , potato , and sugar beet .\nhowever , to date , very few products containing compounds and chemicals derived from crop wastes have made it into the commercial marketplace .\nestimates of market size , market price , potential bio - based share , potential bio - based production size , potential impact for local producers , potential local employment , and prospects for development are very low and rather poor . therefore ,\nbefore large - scale development of bio - based renewable products can take place , more detailed feasibility studies and practical business models are needed .\nthus , long - term collaborations between producers , manufacturers , and business are needed to undertake further translational research to bring these new and novel products to the marketplace .\npresent research has also shown that grain wastes can be used as a source of bioenergy in the forms of bioethanol , biodiesel , and biogas .\nfor example , bioethanol is currently produced from corn in the usa , european union , and china . in tropical regions such as in brazil and columbia\nunfortunately , because of the constraints imposed by available arable land , there is competition between crops specifically grown for biofuel and those grown for food and feed production . because of this competition\n, it is not feasible to increase biofuel production using currently available land and technologies .\nconsequently , current research has focused on developing more advanced or 2nd - generation biofuel production technologies that use wastes derived from grains , fruits , and vegetables . in the last decade\n, significant progress has been made in developing chemical processes that can convert agrowastes into ethanol .\nhowever , major barriers such as the high cost of pretreatments and inefficient conversion processes have prevented the commercialization of large - scale bioethanol processing facilities [ 7880 ] .\nfurther economic analysis has also identified costs barriers such as feedstock chemicals and capital investment that includes pretreatment facilities , fermenters , and steam generation systems as the main factors restricting large - scale processing facilities .\ntherefore , to overcome many of these barriers , further research is needed to improve efficiencies in current plant and equipment and to explore and develop new agrowaste conversion technologies .\nresearch into the generation of biogas from fruit and vegetable wastes has also been carried out .\ncurrently , municipal wastes are recycled through anaerobic digesters to produce biogas , but agrowastes are yet to be converted using this type of processing facility .\nthe main reasons for this are ( 1 ) providing a continuous supply of agrowastes to the facility and ( 2 ) developing cost - effective transportation between waste sources and facilities .\nthus , without a continuous supply of feedstock , the facility is unable to efficiently deliver a steady flow of biogas .\ntherefore , the continuous supply of agrowaste essentially becomes a vehicle routing problem ( vrp ) .\nhowever , vrp has not been specifically applied to transporting food wastes produced by a food supply chain . instead\n, some studies have considered transporting large amounts of food wastes directly between supply points and processing facilities [ 8386 ] . in the case of crop wastes , they are produced at farms , processing facilities , wholesalers , and retailers and are typically spread over fairly large regional areas including both urban and rural ones . therefore , there is a need to collect wastes from various dispersed locations and transport them to processing facilities .\nthus , collecting and transporting food wastes are fundamentally different from harvesting and shipping agriculture crops to market .\nthe difference arises from waste delivery trucks not receiving a full load at any one of the locations .\nfor example , a business may only produce a small amount of food waste that does not make a full load .\nthis necessitates the truck to make multiple pickups from other locations before making its delivery to the processing facility .\nthis type of truck routing is a major cost to food waste collection that has not been fully investigated and could limit large - scale crop waste utilisation . importantly ,\nwhile the impact of large - scale biogas operations using first- or second - generation biofuels is being debated , there is also considerable interest in developing small - scale biomass processing to produce biofuels .\nthe advantage of small - scale biofuel production plant is that it enables local communities to access a renewable energy source .\nsmall - scale biofuel plants can utilise locally produced food waste and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and wood resources .\nlivestock and poultry waste occurs in the early stages of production with animal deaths and animals unsuitable for slaughtering . in the meat industry , the majority of the waste is produced during slaughtering and consists of various nonedible parts that are categorised as byproducts [ 87 , 88 ] .\nmeat byproducts consist of bones , tendons , skin , and contents of the gastrointestinal tract , blood , and internal organs .\ngenerally , meat products have a relatively short shelf - life ranging between 7 and 26 days .\nit is for this reason that meat products immediately go to waste if not sold within the labelled expiry date and this is the main reason for wastage at the retail stage .\nother reasons for meat product waste include packaging size and date confusion among consumers as detailed in table 6 .\nbuzby and hyman in 2012   estimated the total value of meat product waste in the usa at us$ 83,127 million .\ntheir study found that consumers and retailers were responsible for around 35% and 5% , respectively , of the total waste produced , while the total value of poultry waste was estimated at us$ 69,100 million , with consumers being responsible for 37% of the total waste .\nstudies have also revealed a positive growth trend in meat and poultry waste as presented in table 4 .\noverall , there has been an increasing trend in meat consumption around the world with the usa recording the largest increase .\nthe increased consumption is around three times as large as the global average ; however , at the same time , trends in retail and consumer waste levels are not clearly understood as seen in table 4 .\nfurthermore , a study carried out in canada analysing food waste data between 1961 and 2009 found that red meat accounted for 39.73% of the total waste and poultry waste was estimated to be around 40.74% . however\n, this analysis did not include bone waste in the slaughterhouse since no data exists .\nmoreover , it is crucial to note that these percentage wastes only reflect wastage at the consumption stage in the food supply chain and do not take into account farming , processing , and distribution waste data .\nsimilarly , australian consumers waste around aus$ 872.5 million ( us$ 637.5 million ) worth of meat and fish every year .\nunfortunately , meat and poultry waste has not been studied to the same extent as fruit and vegetable wastes . however\n, a limited number of studies presented in table 6 do indicate that most of the waste is produced in the processing of livestock and poultry and the trend is steadily increasing as indicated in table 4 .\ninspection of table 6 reveals that meat processing in the uk accounts for 56% of all wastes [ 36 , 93 ] and in the grouping of 14 european countries processing wastes vary between 35 and 42% .\nunfortunately , there is no data available recording the amount of waste generated during the preslaughtering stage of meat and poultry production . like fruit and vegetable wastes , meat and poultry byproducts\nthe broad diversity of products has the potential to be used in human food products , animal feeds , fertilizers , and biofuels .\ncurrently , both academic and industry researchers are investigating various methods of adding value to meat and poultry products and make better use of their byproducts .\ncurrent research , using the most up - to - date analysis techniques , has been aimed at determining nutritional properties , bioactive molecules , and other useful chemical compounds commonly found in these byproducts .\nmany of these bioactive molecules and chemical compounds have the potential to be used in fields such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals . in many countries ,\nslaughterhouse wastes have already been used to produce cattle and poultry feed , since these wastes are an excellent source of many different types of proteins .\ntwo animal byproducts that have been used without further processing by the fast food industry are tallow and lard .\nunfortunately , consumer anxiety in recent years has restricted the use of these byproducts in the fast food industry . in many cases ,\nmeat , poultry , and dairy processing wastes have the potential to be recycled and processed into higher value and useful products . but inappropriate use of recycled meat byproducts can create major aesthetic and even health problems .\ntherefore , most countries have regulatory requirements that limit the use of meat and poultry wastes in the interests of food safety and quality .\nfor example , at one time , japanese meat and poultry wastes were extensively used in animal feed until a relatively low priced imported feed concentrate entered the marketplace . and\nas a result waste usage declined and out of the 20 million tonnes of wastes being produced each year only 3% was used as fertilizer and 5% as animal feed .\nthe remaining large amounts of waste were incinerated or ended up in landfills . in an attempt to reduce the number of enormous landfill sites , reduce the environmental burden , and prevent gas emissions , the japanese government introduced a new food - recycling law in may 2001 .\nunfortunately , just after its introduction , an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy was reported and created a very negative public response to food recycling .\nconsequently , public concerns and safety issues have prevented food recycling for human and ruminant consumption .\nthe only other way of processing meat and poultry waste in japan is via compost production , but to date there has been limited acceptance of this product by farmers .\neggs are an important food and are extensively used in cooking for the production of a diverse range of food products . in korea ,\nthe annual consumption of eggs was estimated to be around 540,542 tonnes and is expected to increase every year . because of the extremely large amounts of eggs used worldwide , there are also large amounts of egg wastes produced . for instance , in switzerland , 18% of all egg wastes occur during production , around 9% occurs in the retail sector , and a massive 64% is produced by consumers as seen in table 7 . in the north american supply chain , 31.4% of all eggs produced end up as waste . and in the usa around 9% of all egg wastes\nare produced in the retail sector and consumers produce 14% as seen in table 7 .\nimportantly , waste products from both poultry processing and egg production industries must be efficiently dealt with , since growth in both industries largely depends on effective waste management . in the case of egg production , eggs are vulnerable to bacterial attack if the outer shells are not properly and quickly cleaned to remove faecal particles which contain various microorganisms [ 101 , 102 ] .\nin addition , egg waste can also occur during transportation , distribution , and storage if appropriate supportive environment is not supplied .\nfurthermore , because of the extremely large numbers of eggs used worldwide , approximately 50,000 tonnes of eggshells is produced each year .\nthese eggshells contain high levels of calcium carbonate ( caco3 ) that could be used as an alkaline compound to immobilise heavy metals .\ntherefore , recycling eggshells for the immobilization of heavy metals in wastewater has the potential to significantly reduce environmental pollution .\naccordingly , there have been a number studies evaluating eggshells as immobilising agents for heavy metals such as chromium(iii ) and lead [ 104106 ] . however , to date , the practical use of waste eggshells as immobilising agents is still largely unknown .\nthe dairy industry , because of its worldwide importance , has been extensively studied to determine its environmental impact .\nraw milk is processed into products such as consumer milk , butter , cheese , yogurt , condensed milk , dried milk ( milk powder ) , and ice cream . in spite of being extensively studied\n, what is lacking is a comprehensive understanding of waste levels produced throughout the whole dairy industry .\nthe agricultural stage is often reported as the main source of wastes in the life cycle of milk and dairy products [ 108110 ] .\nhowever , studies in the uk and spain have identified the main causes of milk waste coming from poor product quality during the summer period , poor forecasting , packaging mistakes , and breakages occurring at the retail stage .\nthe study also found that poor sales forecasting , slow sales , and cold storage problems during transportation also contributed to the wastage of many dairy products .\nin addition , cleaning and packaging processes associated with dairy products were also found to significantly contribute to waste levels .\nfurthermore , dairy product packaging has also been found to significantly contribute to environmental degradation .\nfor example , the mexican milk industry generates between 3.74 and 11.22 million m of waste products each year , which equates to around one to three times the volume of milk produced annually . and , in the case of denmark , milk and dairy products contribute around 71,000 tonnes of food waste annually , while in the grouping of 14 european countries around 43 to 48% of milk and dairy wastes were produced in the processing stage . in north america supply chain wastage\nwas found to be around 32%   and usa retailers were found to waste around 9% of all dairy products as seen in table 7 .\nother sources of milk and dairy produce waste result from frequent product changes , but this can be reduced through appropriate product sequencing and more efficient product scheduling .\nother methods of reducing milk wastes include capture of fat , protein , and sugars from wastewater produced during milk processing using processes such as evaporation , centrifugation , ultrafiltration , reverse osmosis , and bioconversion .\nthese recapture processes can significantly reduce the amount of milk and dairy wastes being discharged into the environment .\nwaste reduction can also have a significant impact on product processing efficiency and improved financial returns .\nfor instance , cheese is derived from milk and is widely used as a standalone product and component of many food products around the world . during cheese manufacture , acidified milk is mixed with an enzyme to form solid cheese or casein and the remaining liquid is called whey .\nthe waste whey can have a negative impact if dumped directly into the environment . today , around 50% of the world 's whey production is treated and transformed into various food products .\ncurrently , there is a large body of research in the literature that stresses the importance of reducing milk processing waste and wastewater discharge into the environment .\nhowever , the amount of milk and dairy wastes being generated throughout the global food supply chain is still largely unknown .\ntherefore , there is a current need to undertake studies that can identify and document the magnitude of milk and dairy waste occurring throughout the global food supply chain so that proper waste remediation and management steps can be implemented .\nhistorically , fish has always been an import food source and even today it is one of the most traded commodities in international markets .\nit was estimated in 2010 that globally around 54.8 million people were engaged in aquaculture and the wider fishing industry [ 117 , 118 ] .\ncurrently , fish contributes around 16.6% to the total animal protein supply and 6.5% of all proteins consumed by humans worldwide .\nfish also provides high - value protein and a wide range of essential micronutrients such as vitamins , minerals , and polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids . because of the nutritional and health benefits of fish and other seafoods , the demand is always high and annual consumption is increasing globally .\nfor example , the demand for seafood in australia has steadily increased over the last three decades . in 2009 , australians on average consumed 25  kg of seafood , compared with 18.8  kg in 1995 , 17.3  kg in 1985 , and 13.6  kg in 1975 .\nthe data indicates that overall seafood consumption in australia has almost tripled over three decades .\nin parallel with the increasing global demand for seafood , there are growing concerns about the sustainability and management of the fishing industry .\nrecent studies have only discussed wastage in general terms and suggest that waste could be as large as us$ 50 billion each year due to poor management of seafood resources [ 120 , 121 ] . a recent article by costello et al .\nillustrated how fish waste could be reduced in a sustainable way if appropriate management changes were undertaken .\nthe study highlighted that the less studied fisheries have not been closely monitored or assessed , so there is no data recording the amount of waste being produced .\ndifferent types and quantities of fish waste are produced throughout the food supply chain , commencing with capture and ending with consumption .\nworldwide , around 130 million tonnes of fish waste is produced each year by fisheries and aquaculture .\nwastes are produced through by - catch , on - board processing , transport , storage , retailers , and consumers .\nfish waste generation begins during wild catching , with by - catch or unintentional catching of marine species being discarded .\nthis problem has been extensively studied and in spite of environmental and business guidelines there is still no effective solution to by - catch waste [ 125 , 126 ] .\nit is estimated that globally around 17.9 to 39.5 million tonnes of whole fish is discarded each year by commercial fishing operations . following capture ,\nprocessing is the main stage in the food supply chain where most waste occurs . during processing , only the fillets are preserved and the remainder of the fish ( up to 66% ) is thrown away as seen in figure 3 [ 127 , 128 ] . a study by gavine et al\n. found that the southeastern australian seafood industry produced fish waste estimated to be around 20,000 tonnes per year and cost around us$ 150 per tonne to dispose of in landfill sites . in reality ,\nnot only does the waste disposal have a significant cost , but also it has a major environmental impact .\ninterestingly , in the uk , each tonne of cod purchased by a processor costs about  2,000 ( us$ 3,129 ) and around 50% of the cod ends up as processing waste .\nregrettably , the waste only generates an income of  40 ( us$ 63 ) as a byproduct and in the worst - case scenario its disposal costs around  60 ( us$ 94 ) .\nsimilarly , only around 43% of shellfish and other fish species are suitable for human consumption and the remaining are classified as waste .\nit has been estimated that in the uk both meat and fish processing were responsible for about 56% of all wastes produced in the food supply chain as shown in table 6 [ 36 , 93 ] .\na study of a grouping of 14 european countries revealed that fish processing waste could range between 40 and 70% .\nthus , it is apparent from these studies that the processing stage is the main contributor to overall waste levels .\nresearch into retail and consumer waste has shown that consumers in the usa are the major contributor to fish waste .\ninterestingly , the trend in waste by consumers has steadily increased from 16% in 1995 to 31% in 2010 despite having efficient transport and storage facilities [ 13 , 17 , 58 ] .\nthe reasons for the high levels of waste by usa consumers are unknown and need further investigation .\nthe disposal route for seafood waste is not as straightforward as grains and other crop products .\nthis is because the disposal of seafood wastes involves stricter hygiene , safety , and management of environmental hazards during its disposal and in many cases its disposal is regulated by government organisations .\nfor example , in the uk , landfill costs are much higher for seafood waste disposal because the waste is not categorised as  inactive / inert  waste .\nfurthermore , regulations regarding the burial or burning of seafood waste are restrictive if there are any alternative utilisation pathways available . however , some fish farming businesses are paying higher landfill costs to dispose of fish wastes compared to other methods of disposal .\ncurrently , around 59% of all fish wastes go to landfill and only around 39% are reused or incinerated as seen in figure 4 . to reduce the large amount of fish waste produced worldwide , a number of alternative strategies have been developed to add economic value to the wastes .\nfor instance , two different methods , mass transformation and sorting , have been developed to improve the economic value of fish wastes .\ntypical examples of transformed fish waste include fishmeal , fish oil , fertilisers , and hydrolysates such as protein hydrolysate .\nalternatively , sorting involves utilising various fish body parts such as bones , guts , and fins separately to enhance their economic value .\nfor example , sorting enables the production of specialised products such as liver oil , gelatine , omega-3 , protein containing sports food and drinks , calcium , cosmetics , and pharmaceuticals .\nwider acceptance and adoption of both methods could lead to significant reductions in wastes going to landfill and reduce the damaging impact of fish wastes on the environment .\nfor example , converting fish wastes into fishmeal has been steadily increasing in recent years with many countries converting their fish wastes using cost - effective reprocessing technologies [ 118 , 133 ] . in spite of the reprocessing costs associated with converting fish waste into fishmeal ,\nfor example , in japan , 90% of the ingredients used in fishmeal are derived from fish wastes .\ncurrently , there are only around ten major countries converting fish waste into fishmeal products , that is , canada , chile , denmark , iceland , japan , mexico , norway , russian federation , thailand , and the usa .\nhowever , these countries on average are only using around 25% of their fish wastes to produce fishmeal products .\nimportantly , fishmeal contains essential amino acids and as a result it is currently the most widely used protein ingredient in aquaculture feeds .\nthus , fishmeal usage over a 50-year period ( 1960 to 2010 ) reveals its increased use in aquaculture , while its use in both swine and poultry feeds has declined as seen in figure 5 .\none of the contributing factors for this trend was the ban imposed by the european economic commission on the use of animal byproducts being used in animal feeds . and\nsimilar regulations in the usa have also contributed to the increased usage of fishmeal in aquaculture . in spite of fishmeal\nbeing used globally , there has only been limited use of other fish waste byproducts .\nfish wastes can also be processed to produce oil , silage , fertiliser , composting matter , and fish protein concentrates .\nfurthermore , fish wastes are also a rich source of chitin , chitosan , carotenoid pigments , and enzymes that can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals .\nbut , to date , very little has been done to fully develop and commercialise these types of products .\nhowever , it should be noted that fish waste processing can be a difficult business in many countries due to problematic issues such as hygiene , safety , and environmental hazards .\nin addition , the most important factor that any business needs to consider is the economic viability of fish waste processing [ 140 , 141 ] .\nfor example , large volumes of both solid and liquid wastes are produced after processing nile perch from lake victoria in east africa .\nannually , around 36,000 tonnes of solid waste and approximately 1,838,000  m of produced wastewater containing valuable nutrients are discharged .\nthis rich source of lipids and proteins has the potential to produce value - added products through bioconversion .\nhowever , current fish waste management in east africa was found to be inefficient and nonprofitable and was unable to take advantage of the rich source of lipids and proteins present in the wastewater , thus highlighting the need for efficient waste utilisation and waste reduction strategies that can provide viable and profitable options for fish waste processing .\na number of aquaculture based industrial studies have examined various types of methods for dealing with seafood waste and its utilisation in australia [ 136 , 144 , 145 ] .\nfor example , fish wastes are a rich source of essential fatty acids and fish skin - and - bone parts are suitable mineral supplements in fish diets .\nhowever , further studies are needed to fully investigate large - scale profitable fish waste processing .\non the whole , fish waste processing and utilisation have steadily increased over the years , but several issues restrict its full - scale operation .\nin particular , environmental issues are major factors preventing large - scale development since fish processing plants can be significant polluters .\nobviously , there are good economic and environmental reasons to process fish waste and produce value - added products .\nbut further work is needed to develop effective and efficient methods of processing fish wastes at an economically viable industrial scale with as little environmental impact as possible .\nit is interesting to note that the literature in the field often overlooks aquatic plant food wastes .\naquatic plant foods such as algae have been used for both human and animal nutrition for thousands of years .\nthe earliest writings of the ancient greeks recorded in the bellum africanum , written around 45 b.c . , describe the greeks collecting seaweed from local shorelines and feeding it to their cattle .\nmany aquatic plants are very rich in protein and are a highly nutritional food that can offer many beneficial advantages as a food supplement as well as having significant medicinal properties [ 148150 ] . in the search for sources of natural antioxidants ,\nboth algae and microalgae are widely known and consumed in many countries for their advantageous health benefits .\nin particular , many algae and microalgae are rich sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have the potential to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases [ 151 , 152 ] . in asian countries like china , japan , and korea , the production and consumption of edible aquatic plants had a long tradition .\nthis long - standing tradition has resulted in the widespread incorporation of aquatic plants into the global food supply [ 153155 ] . rather than just relying on marine capture ,\ncurrently over 95.5% of the total global production of aquatic plants is supplied by aquaculture .\nthis equates to around 0.44 million tonnes of marine capture and about 12 million tonnes being produced by aquaculture in 2010 as seen in figure 6 .\nstudies have shown that the majority of aquaculture production , around 9 million tonnes , was destined for human consumption .\nphycocolloids were extracted from the remaining aquatic plants to be used as nutritional supplements in various forms of farm animal and aquaculture feedstock [ 156 , 157 ] .\nto date , there has been very little data reported in the literature and wastes levels produced by aquatic plant food industries remain relatively unknown .\ntherefore , there is a current need to undertake research into aquatic plant food supply chain to determine the current amount of waste , level of utilisation , and management protocols in use .\nhowever , in recent years , research has focused on using microalgae in the production of biodiesel .\nthe first is the high growth rate and the second is the high oil content . for example , microalga typically doubles its biomass every 24 hours under normal growing conditions , while the oil content of microalgae can range from 15 to 75% ( dry weight ) and annually can produce oil from 58,700 up to around 136,900 litres per hectare [ 158 , 159 ] .\ncurrently , biodiesel production depends on crops such as soybean , rapeseed , canola , sunflower , corn , palm kernels , animal fat , and oils .\nthe biggest hurdle preventing the full - scale production of biodiesel from these crops is land availability . since the land area needed by microalgae is small compared to oil producing crops ,\nthere has been considerable interest in exploring the use of microalgae as an alternative feedstock for the production of biodiesel .\nthe disadvantage of using microalgae for producing biodiesel is the high cost of production and separation that is needed to remove microalgal biomass from the growing media [ 159 , 162 ] .\nanother challenge associated with microalgae production in open ponds is contamination from a wide range of naturally occurring algae and bacteria .\nbut similar issues encountered for biodiesel production are also prevalent for bioethanol production such as algal biomass separation and contamination [ 163 , 164 ] .\ninterestingly , if aquatic plant food wastes proved suitable , they could also be evaluated as a possible feedstock for the production bioenergy products .\nat present , there is very little information in the literature discussing the industrial scale utilisation of food wastes at the local , national , or international level .\nfor example , fruit and vegetable wastes have been extensively studied and reported in the literature . however , food wastes produced and their utilisation in aquaculture , livestock , poultry , and dairy industries are rarely reported and need further research .\nmuch of the currently available food waste data lacks sufficient details and there is even less information discussing waste utilisation in the respective food supply chains .\nthis information is needed before any economic modelling can be done to determine the feasibility of new products and waste transforming facilities needed to produce a commercially successful business outcome .\nthe first step in developing a successful waste utilisation strategy is to assess the type and magnitude of waste [ 165 , 166 ] . once waste levels and their location in the food supply chain are known , it is now possible to start developing an effective waste management plan . in developing an effective plan ,\nseveral important factors need to be considered before successful waste utilisation can be achieved as seen in figure 7 .\nultimately , the main barrier to developing any waste management plan that produces a new product from food waste needs to take into account several strategic factors , for example , new market opportunities , market trends , current market developments , and producing a product that is competitive in the marketplace .\nfurthermore , each stage of product development needs to be carefully considered . in the case of manufacturing , a company will need to consider commercial opportunities based on a well - thought - out growth strategy , especially if innovation is a key factor of the product . for packaging and distribution , the product range and associated services will also need to be carefully considered with the view of preventing competitor copying and safeguards to maintain market share . from a governmental perspective\n, policies may need to be formulated that promote sustainable patterns of consumption and sustainable community lifestyles , foster new job creation strategies , and enhance the economy . for consumers ,\nthe combination of diversity , choice , and expectation of high quality produce is a very important issue in their selection process . in summary ,\nany new product produced from a food waste utilisation process that enters the marketplace will need to be both economically and ecologically sustainable .\nhowever , at the end of the day , it is consumer acceptance of the new product that is the deciding factor . a recent study by kummu et al\n. found that the preferred option for food waste utilisation was to use wastes generated from agriculture and consumers . from a global perspective , their study suggested that 47% of agricultural food wastes and over 86% of consumer wastes could be effectively utilised .\nthe study also found that the biggest improvements in food waste management would occur where the demand for additional food was the least .\ntherefore , to effectively manage food waste , there needs to be awareness of the benefits of postharvest waste utilisation by farmers , food processors , and government agencies .\nthis awareness is needed so that food waste management capacity can be built up and ultimately lead to improvements in converting wastes into value - added products .\nimportantly , it is also necessary to fully understand the size of the problem so that there are opportunities to improve food security and reduce poverty using effective waste utilisation strategies . in addition\n, the reduction of food wastes by effective waste management also reduces environmental degradation and improves economic sustainability of the food supply chain\n. however , the most important factors that will contribute to the success of any food waste utilisation strategy are its acceptance by the community at large .\nwhenever food waste utilisation is debated , it is generally discussed in terms of processing methods , but actual food supply chain losses and their true impacts are often undervalued and underreported . undervaluing and underreporting\nexploring these  hidden costs  usually acts as a catalyst for determining the scale of the waste problem , since businesses will only become aware of the problem when it impacts their bottom line .\ngenerally , food related businesses often resolve their waste management problems by keeping their profitability levels high .\nthey usually achieve this goal by reducing energy consumption , reducing raw material usage , and improving recycling activities .\nfurthermore , businesses will investigate the merits of managing wastes in terms of recovery and value adding as opposed to the cost of disposal .\nin fact , the disposal cost will have a direct impact on whether a business will go down the recovery and value - adding option or take the waste disposal route .\ntherefore , food waste management options will often involve a cost versus benefit analysis that ultimately determines businesses profitability .\nhowever , because of business confidentiality reasons , food waste management costs are normally not reported .\nthis often leads to partial and unproven estimates of the impact of food waste and makes assessments of waste management strategies difficult .\nfor instance , in many developed countries , the main driver for waste management strategies is government legislation relating to safety , handling of hazardous waste materials , and the environmental impact of the businesses operational practices . in developing countries , factors such as food type , processing facilities , storage facilities , transport , and even climatic conditions are the principal drivers in food waste management strategies . for example , the drivers for fish , meat , and poultry waste utilisation are health safety and hygiene risks associated with processing the wastes , whereas the economic drivers for fruit and vegetable waste management include microbial spoilage , costs of drying , storage , and shipment of byproducts .\nfurthermore , these drivers become even more demanding if the food wastes are to be converted into high quality functional compounds . therefore , waste processing strategies must be optimised to promote production efficiency and cost - effectiveness so that the final products are competitive in the marketplace . consequently\n, a cost - and - benefit analysis is of paramount importance before any business adopts a food waste utilisation and management strategy .\nthe most important factor that needs to be carefully considered when planning to adopt a food waste utilisation strategy that aims to produce value - added products is the consumer .\nexperience has shown that consumers are often reluctant to accept new products , even when they can see its benefits .\nthis is why consumer behaviour or habit needs to be fully understood when developing and marketing any new product .\nfor example , surveys have consistently shown that consumers are very concerned about the environment and whether new products are ecofriendly [ 178180 ] , with consumer queries often focusing on whether environmental guidelines were followed during product manufacture . in australia , around 62% of all consumer queries involve issues concerning environmental impact .\na similar study in sweden found that customers ranked product taste first , while environmental impact was ranked second .\nthe results of both studies clearly indicate the importance of environmental issues to consumers and how this translates into their purchasing behaviour .\nthese results also emphasise the importance of educating consumers on the ecofriendly nature of products processed from food wastes and their positive impact on reducing environmental degradation .\neducation is particularly important since most consumers are only aware of industrial pollution and wildlife conservation .\nin fact , consumer knowledge relating to the production and distribution of food they purchase and its environmental impact is poor .\nthus , consumers need product information so that they can make informed decisions and make ecofriendly based choices when selecting products .\nproviding information in the form of fact sheets at the point of sale or by environmental indicator labelling on product packaging would assist consumers in making informed decisions .\nin recent years , consumers have become more aware of increasing costs of gas , electricity , and petrol prices .\naccordingly , consumers have been encouraged to reduce their home energy consumption using a number of strategies aimed at improving domestic energy efficiency .\nunfortunately , no similar strategies have been aimed at raising the awareness of food waste utilisation .\nin fact , very few strategies have highlighted the negative environmental impact of dumping food wastes in landfill sites and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions .\nthus , consumer education and acceptance of value - added products derived from food wastes will ultimately determine the success of any food waste utilisation and management strategy . through education , consumers will see the value of these waste derived products and their positive environmental impact .\nthis will ultimately influence consumer behaviour and promote purchasing patterns towards food waste derived value - added products .\ntoday , there is a general absence of detailed information and understanding of the extent of food wastage at different stages of the food value chain from farm to fork .\nthe scale of food waste throughout the food supply chain is complex and can have a significant impact on a number of different fields such as agriculture , food security , economics , waste utilisation and management , environmental conservation , and human health . to resolve food waste problems and promote food waste utilisation strategies in any country\nthere are a number of hurdles preventing the conversion of food waste to value - added products .\nthese hurdles include developing effective cost / benefit food waste utilisation strategies , developing efficient ecofriendly reprocessing technologies , reducing environmental degradation , and public acceptance .\nglobally , a number of countries are tackling the problems associated with increasing food waste and food waste utilisation and management .\nfor example , several european countries are promoting utilisation and management strategies such as bioenergy production and regulating landfill costs to discourage waste generation .\nthe key to successful food waste utilisation and management is to develop appropriate ecofriendly reprocessing technologies that can convert all the valuable components present in the waste into valuable products and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill .\nconsumer awareness and education is one such challenge . without consumer acceptance of food waste reduction approaches ,\nthe present work has also identified the need for more detailed studies identifying where , why , and how much food waste is produced between farm and fork ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " in recent years , the problem of food waste has attracted considerable interest from food producers , processors , retailers , and consumers alike . \n food waste is considered not only a sustainability problem related to food security , but also an economic problem since it directly impacts the profitability of the whole food supply chain . in developed countries \n , consumers are one of the main contributors to food waste and ultimately pay for all wastes produced throughout the food supply chain . to secure food and reduce food waste , it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the various sources of food wastes throughout the food supply chain . \n the present review examines various reports currently in the literature and quantifies waste levels and examines the trends in wastage for various food sectors such as fruit and vegetable , fisheries , meat and poultry , grain , milk , and dairy . \n factors contributing to food waste , effective cost / benefit food waste utilisation methods , sustainability and environment considerations , and public acceptance are identified as hurdles in preventing large - scale food waste processing . \n thus , we highlight the need for further research to identify and report food waste so that government regulators and food supply chain stakeholders can actively develop effective waste utilisation practices .

hash marks designate censored observations .\nnumber of participants at risk in each group is listed below the xaxis . a small subset of participants ( 3 of 51 and 2 of 19 in the normal and elevated galectin3 groups , respectively ) had no followup time .\nhaving any of the comorbidities listed ( current or prior tobacco use , systemic hypertension , obstructive sleep apnea , dyslipidemia , history of subacute bacterial endocarditis , or asthma ) tended to be associated with a higher risk of the combined outcome , although the association was not statistically significant ( hr 2.5 , 95% ci 0.9 to 7.4 , p=0.09 ) .\nhigh galectin3 remained a significant predictor of outcome after excluding participants with a chronic comorbidity ( hr 6.1 , 95% ci 1.7 to 21.6 , p=0.005 ; n=58 ) or adjusting for presence of a chronic comorbidity ( hr 5.8 , 95% ci 2.0 to 16.4 , p=0.001 ; hr for having a comorbidity 2.3 , 95% ci 0.8 to 6.9 , p=0.13 ) .\nthere was no statistically significant difference in galectin3 level between the 5 patients who died and those who survived ( 14.44.7 versus 12.95.0  ng / ml ;

studies have not demonstrated any single circulating biomarker to be strongly associated with mortality or other specific longitudinal outcomes.31 , 32 , 33 this makes the strong , independent association between high galectin3 level and adverse outcomes especially noteworthy .\nthe small number of specific types of adverse event , such as arrhythmic death , precludes extensive exploration to determine whether galectin3 is associated with a particular subset of adverse outcomes\nwe did , however , observe a strong association between clinical ascites and high galectin3 level .\nthe pattern of medication use , more common use of loop and potassiumsparing diuretics , further supports a relationship between galectin3 and clinical volume retention .\nalthough it may be that galectin3 simply reflects disease severity in these patients ( eg , a marker of cumulative fibrosis or ongoing inflammation ) , there are several mechanisms by which elevated galectin3 may have a causal role in fontan deterioration .\na study reported , for example , that galectin3 knockout mice demonstrated less peritoneal inflammation in response to intraperitoneal thioglycollate broth injection.34 recurrent ascites is a common issue for adult fontan patients ; often it is not readily explained by hemodynamic findings , and the cause is unknown .\nif so , compounds under development to inhibit the actions of galectin3 might be a promising therapy for this challenging clinical syndrome .\nthe relationship between galectin3 and hscrp , a nonspecific marker of inflammation , is also noteworthy .\nprior studies have also reported a positive association between galectin3 and hscrp , although the strength of association has generally been weaker than seen in our study ( r0.13 to 0.25).24 , 25 , 35 further investigation is warranted regarding why these patients develop an inflammatory response , the typical pattern of immune activation , and the role of inflammation in the diverse causes of premature fontan failure and subsequent death .\nhigher galectin3 was also associated with lower egfr , as has been reported in prior studies of other groups of patients .\nthis may be because high galectin3 plays a causal role in progressive kidney disease , because fontan dysfunction is independently associated with both low egfr and high galectin3 , or because galectin3 handling is affected by kidney disease.19 , 36 because very few patients had low egfr ( n=2 , < 60  ml / min per 1.73  m ) , the last reason is unlikely to explain our findings .\ngalectin3 was higher in fontan patients than in an age and sexmatched comparison group , although the absolute values were lower in both groups compared with those reported in most prior studies , including those in the general adult population and in acquired heart failure .\nmedian galectin3 , for example , was 13.1  ng / ml in men and 14.3  ng / ml in women in a sample of 3353 community participants in the framingham heart study with an average age of 59  years.17 christenson and colleagues reported 20.3  ng / ml as the 95th percentile for galectin3 in a diverse populationbased sample of 1092 ostensibly healthy participants aged 55 to 80  years.18 the younger age of our sample likely explains the lower values .\nalthough reference values for other age groups are not yet available , we observed that galectin3 increased with age in fontan participants ; this pattern has also been reported in the general population and in acquired heart failure.17 \n  there was an association between use of thyroid replacement medication and high galectin3 .\nthis association may be spurious related to the low absolute number of patients on thyroid medication , or it may be related to an independent relationship between thyroid disease and galectin337 , 38 or to amiodarone toxicity .\nthe lack of relationship between underlying congenital diagnosis , ventricular morphology , or fontan type may be related to the relatively low sample size .\nresults from analyses of incomplete data related to clinical practice patterns ( ie , catheterization and btype natriuretic peptide results ) are particularly susceptible to unmeasured confounding and bias .\nfurthermore , although there was no statistically significant association between galectin3 and hemodynamic variables , this study may have been underpowered to detect even a clinically relevant association\n. the small number of events precluded comprehensive multivariable adjustment , and our findings may be attributable to confounders such as chronic kidney disease .\nthe age and sexmatched comparison group represents a convenience sample and may not derive from an equivalent atrisk population such as the fontan participants .\nwe did not measure other established or promising biomarkers for prediction of outcomes in acquired heart failure , such as nterminal btype natriuretic peptide or st2.39 , 40 a multimarker approach with pathophysiologically complementary biomarkers may provide additional information , as it may in patients with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.41 , 42 we also did not measure galectin3 longitudinally , and it is possible that a change in levels over time could improve the prognostic value compared with a single measurement and may even serve as a surrogate marker of response to therapy .\nthe current results hint that galectin3 may be a useful clinical predictor in fontan patients ; however , further study is required not only to validate the robustness of our findings but also to demonstrate that galectin3 provides information beyond that available from alternative biomarkers and other clinical variables .\nin addition , the relationship between age and galectin3 suggests that a given absolute level of galectin3 may have different implications for younger and older patients .\nthe lack of relationship between underlying congenital diagnosis , ventricular morphology , or fontan type may be related to the relatively low sample size .\nresults from analyses of incomplete data related to clinical practice patterns ( ie , catheterization and btype natriuretic peptide results ) are particularly susceptible to unmeasured confounding and bias . furthermore , although there was no statistically significant association between galectin3 and hemodynamic variables , this study may have been underpowered to detect even a clinically relevant association\n. the small number of events precluded comprehensive multivariable adjustment , and our findings may be attributable to confounders such as chronic kidney disease .\nthe age and sexmatched comparison group represents a convenience sample and may not derive from an equivalent atrisk population such as the fontan participants .\nwe did not measure other established or promising biomarkers for prediction of outcomes in acquired heart failure , such as nterminal btype natriuretic peptide or st2.39 , 40 a multimarker approach with pathophysiologically complementary biomarkers may provide additional information , as it may in patients with acute coronary syndrome or heart failure.41 , 42 we also did not measure galectin3 longitudinally , and it is possible that a change in levels over time could improve the prognostic value compared with a single measurement and may even serve as a surrogate marker of response to therapy . the current results hint that galectin3 may be a useful clinical predictor in fontan patients ;

wise categorizations in the study were done as in groupwise categorization , any patient in a particular group may have a combination of various sites present , i.e. , periodontally healthy , gingivitis , mild to moderate periodontitis , and severe periodontitis sites , or the disease is not uniform at all sites .\nfurther , in our daily clinical practice , an individual patient is considered as an entity .\nall the sites in that particular category had the same severity of disease or the disease was uniform , thereby controlling for the variations in periodontal inflammation . in the present study ,\ncomparison and reproducibility of mean pd  cal measurements with manual and florida probe were evaluated .\nthe mean gi increased significantly from group a to group d [ table 1 ] which could be attributed to the increase in the gingival inflammation which further indicates the increase in the severity of the disease .\nthe inflamed tissues offer less resistance to probing as compared to the healthy tissues , so the probe tip penetration in healthy tissues is less than the inflamed tissues . between two registrations , a time interval of at least 15 minutes\nwas introduced to eliminate a possible bias due to examiners memory so that the second measurement could not be influenced by the first , and it also provided adequate rest to the patient in between different probing registrations . to minimize the effect of bias and for the authenticity and validity of the data , two examiners were chosen .\nwhen considering the full mouth mean pd  sd as recorded by manual probe and florida probe for all the four groups as well as sites by examiner 1 , it was observed that the mean pd recorded by manual and florida probes increased from group a to group d and also from periodontally healthy to severe periodontitis sites , with a significant difference between them , suggesting the increase in the severity of the disease with the degree of inflammation present .\ngroup- and site - wise intraexaminer comparisons between the manual probe and florida probe by examiner 1 revealed that full mouth pd obtained with the manual probe was statistically significantly deeper than that obtained with the florida probe .\nsimilar results were obtained by both examiners in ramfjord teeth , with manual probe measurements being statistically significantly deeper as compared to florida probe ( m1 > f1 and m2 > f2 ) in all groups and sites . when interexaminer group- and site - wise comparison of pd measurements by manual and florida probes ( m1 , f2 and m2 , f1 ) in ramfjord teeth was done , the measurements recorded by manual probe of examiner 1 and florida probe of examiner 2 increased from group a to group d and from periodontally healthy to severe periodontitis sites with statistically significant differences between them .\npd measurements recorded by manual probe by examiners 1 and 2 were deeper as compared to florida probe in all the groups and sites ( m1 > f2 and m2 > f1 ) .\n, osborn et al . , gupta et al . , magnusson et al . , perry et al . , osborn et al . , rams and slots , quirynen et al . , tupta - veselicky et al . , hull et al . , breen et al . , and barendregt et al .\nin the interexaminer group- and site - wise comparisons , icc for manual probe was higher as compared to the florida probe .\nthe manual probe proved to be more reliable than electronic probe in pd measurements , in accordance with reports by buduneli et al .\n, quirynen et al . , barendregt et al . , wang et al . , wang et al . , mayfield et al . , and\n, who concluded that such automated devices offered no significant advantage over manual probes which was in contrast to the studies of samuel et al . , magnusson et al . ,\nrams and slots , and araujo et al . in our study , the differences in the pd with manual recordings being deeper than the florida probe measurements may be attributed to uncontrolled probing force while using manual probe and also lack of tactile sensitivity and placement problems of florida probe , especially in proximal areas because of its size and sleeve . rounding off of the measurements of the manual probe , difficulty in visual read out\nthe lesser reproducibility of florida probe as compared to manual probe may be due to the lack of familiarity with the automated probe .\nfull mouth mean cal  sd by manual probe and florida probe for groups c and d and also their respective sites by examiner 1 increased from group c to group d and from mild - moderate to severe periodontitis sites with the differences being significant .\nthe reason for this increase may be attributed to the increase in the severity of the disease with subsequent increase in the gingival inflammation .\ngroup- and site - wise intraexaminer comparison between the manual probe and florida probe by examiner 1 and by both examiners in ramfjord teeth revealed that cal obtained with the manual probe in group c and mild - moderate periodontitis sites was statistically significantly lower than cal obtained with the florida probe , whereas cal obtained with the manual probe in group d or severe periodontitis sites was statistically significantly higher than cal obtained with the florida probe .\nsimilar results were also obtained when the interexaminer group- and site - wise comparison of cal measurements by manual and florida probes ( m1 , f2 and m2 , f1 ) were done .\nthe group d and severe periodontitis sites are following the same trend as that of pd with the measurements by manual probe being greater than the florida probe by both the examiners , as the factors affecting the pd measurement by manual and florida probe are applicable to cal measurement as well .\nthe contrasting results of the cal measurement in group c and mild - moderate periodontitis sites could be attributed to the fact that in our study , in mild to moderate periodontitis group , out of total of 713 cal sites , 38.2% of sites had gingival recession whereas 61.8% sites had no recession , so identification of cej by florida probe in this group was difficult because of hidden cej .\nidentification of the cej is often complicated by its subgingival location and lack of clear demarcation felt by probing .\nin addition , lack of familiarity with the new probe ( florida probe ) might be the contributing factor in difficulty in cej detection .\nhence , the florida probe demonstrated higher mean cal in mild to moderate periodontitis group as compared to severe periodontitis group , whereas in severe periodontitis group , out of total of 1390 cal sites , 66.6% of sites had gingival recession and 33.4% sites had no recession . hence , detection of cej in this group was easier as the cej was exposed and the cej probe could easily measure the cal .\nin the interexaminer group- and site - wise comparison , icc for manual probe was higher as compared to the florida probe which was in accordance with reports by wang et al . , jeffcoat and reddy , reddy et al . , and oringer et al .\n, deepa and prakash , and jeffcoat et al . in our study , the differences in cal measurement between manual and florida probe in mild - moderate and severe periodontitis groups and sites may be attributed to the fact that florida probe is able to identify and locate cej easily by the sleeve of the probe in cases with gingival recession .\nthe lesser reproducibility of florida probe as compared to manual probe may be due to lack of familiarity with the automated probe and also to the increased resolution of florida probe which might have led to greater variation in repeated measurements .\nmean pd and cal measurements were found to be deeper with the manual probe as compared to the florida probe in all the groups and sites , except for the mild -

initiated short rna molecules that are considered to post - transcriptionally regulate the cleavage of target mrnas or just repress their translation ( 1 ) .\nit is estimated that mirnas constitute nearly 1% of all predicted genes in nematodes , flies and mammals 2 .\n, 5 .. the significance of mirnas had been long overlooked due to the limitation of technology and methodology until its initial discovery that two mirnas , lin-4 and let-7 , were found to control the timing of the nematode ( caenorbabditis elegans ) development through incomplete base pairing to the 3 utrs of the target mrnas to repress their translation 6 .\n, 7 .. shortly after that , reinhart et al . detected the existence of mirnas in arabidopsis by northern blot and the result suggests that this type of non - coding rnas may arise early in eukaryotic evolution ( 8) .\nthereafter , an increasing number of mirnas have been successively identified through computational and experimental methods in animals , plants and even viruses .\nthe regulatory roles of mirnas have been identified not only in developmental timing , cell differentiation , proliferation and apoptosis , but also in tumorigenesis and host - pathogen interactions 9 .\n, 14 .. it has been shown that mirna genes frequently coincide with fragile sites and hot spots for chromosomal abnormalities or locate near cancer susceptibility loci that correlate with tumorigenesis 15 .\n, 16 . , 17 .. although a large number of mirna genes disperse over the genome , clustered ones are found coexpressed as polycistronic units that may have functional relationships ( 5 ) .\nin addition , more than half of mirnas reside in introns of their host genes and coexpress with their neighboring protein - coding sequences , and some may derive from common primary transcripts and even share the same promoters 5 . , 18 .\n20 .. nevertheless , a sizable number of mirna genes come from regions that are distal from previously annotated protein - coding sequences and such locations imply that they probably derive from independent transcription units with their own promoters ( 1 ) .\na picture over the long course of evolution emerges , in which mirnas originate from different mechanisms to perform functional roles for the best utilization of genome materials .\nfirst , most of the known mirnas are encoded as polycistronic transcripts , suggesting that members of the same mirna family may evolve simultaneously and develop in similar ways .\nsecond , it has been known that a considerable number of mirnas are highly conserved in sequences among different organisms and the cross - species conserved mirnas possess a special  seed  sequence in their 5 terminus ; such a conservation suggests that these molecules participate in critical cellular processes ( 17 ) .\nthird , mirnas tend to target and regulate a set of mrnas instead of a specific mrna substrate .\nfourth , direct experimental evidence supports the notion that the mirna pathway is an ancient regulatory mechanism evolved before the divergence of multicellular and unicellular organisms ( 21 ) .\nfinally , special cases among viruses are worthy mentioning : due to their higher mutation rates and faster evolution processes , most viral mirnas do not seem to share significant homology with those of their vertebrate counterparts , even within members of the same family ( 10 ) . a reasonable explanation links\nthis phenomenon with their rapid adaptation to host environments , and the lack of homology poses challenges for computational biologists to precisely predict mirnas based on sequence conservations alone .\nit is noticeable that , with the development of the next - generation sequencing technologies and other endeavors , mirnas from various species are springing up in an inconceivable speed and greatly enrich the database 22 .\nit has been shown that an individual mirna is able to control the expression of more than one target mrnas and that each mrna may be regulated by multiple mirnas .\nthe 5 region of mirna usually contributes more to the specificity and activity in binding targets according to experimental evidence . the interactions between mirna and mrna are usually restricted to the  seed  sequence near the 5 terminus in animals despite the fact that most plant mirnas regulate their targets based on complete complementarity ( 25 ) .\nthe ~6 to 8-nt  seed  sequence is highly conserved among species and even a slight change in sequence may alter its target spectra . it is also suggested that the location of central loop in the mirna : mrna duplexes may play a key role in affecting the efficiency of gene regulation mediated by mirnas ( 26 ) .\ncurrent target prediction programs depend on the information from sequence , structure - associated free energy and evolutionary conservation to predict candidate mrnas 27 .\n, 28 .. those bioinformatic methods usually result in the prediction of tens or hundreds of targets for each mirna with high false positive rates ( 29 ) . therefore , further experiments of gain - of - function and loss - of - function are still needed and will determine how many of these predicted targets are genuinely targeted by mirnas .\nmirnas control the target expression by base pairing to sequence motifs in the 3 utr of mrnas with perfect or near perfect complementarities 30 .\n, 31 .. for example , in drosophila , a large number of mirnas have been identified to perfectly complement to the 3 utr of mrnas , including k box , brd box , gy box and proneural box , which are validated to mediate negative post - transcriptional regulation ( 30 ) .\nrecently , certain au - rich elements in 3 utr were uncovered to interact with mirnas and act both directly and indirectly as potent post - transcriptional regulatory signals ( 32 ) .\nanalysis of the mirna target sites indicated that genes with longer 3 utrs usually have higher density of mirna - binding sites and are mainly involved in developmental modulations , whereas genes with shorter 3 utrs usually have lower density of mirna - binding sites and tend to be involved in basic cellular processes 33 .\n, 35 .. these facts emphasize the importance of 3 utr in interacting with mirnas .\nit is also claimed that a small subset of mirnas from plants and animals exert repression regulation by specifically targeting the 5 utr of some mrnas 36 .\n, 37 .. lee et al . suggested that based on both hybridization energy and sequence matches , many endogenous motifs within human 5 utrs are specific to the 3 ends of mirnas ( 38 ) .\nin other words , many mirnas may contain significant interaction sites with mrna 5-utr and 3-utr motifs through their 3- and 5-end sequences , respectively .\nrecently , it has been reported that methods integrating factors such as 5 utr and protein repression level into the sophisticated target prediction processes greatly improved the possibility of identifying real targets 38 .\n, 39 .. in addition , candidate target sites of mirnas falling in the protein - coding regions are also identifiable based on computational and experimental approaches 36 . , 40 . , 41\n.. the fact that 3 utr is a significant yet not the only binding target for mirnas leaves one possibility open , that is , mirnas identify their targets by multiple pathways or modes ( 42 ) .\nthe impact of the interaction between mirnas and their targets is further complicated than it was thought . given the observation that mir-122 , a liver - specific mirna , binds to the 5 non - coding region of the rna hcv ( hepatitis c virus ) genome and induces the accumulation of viral rnas , it seems that mir-122 can act on viral rna replication rather than rna translation or stability ( 37 ) .\nin addition , vasudevan and collaborators demonstrated that mirnas oscillate between repression and activation in the duration of a cell cycle , and they identified mir369 - 3 in proliferating cells , which represses the translation of targets but switches to mediate activation process in cell - cycle arrest ( g1/g0 ) ( 43 ) .\nmirnas also appear to activate certain mrna targets in stress conditions , such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation 43 . , 44 .. whether these up - regulation phenomena happen in special conditions or in ubiquitous regulatory mechanisms remains to be further illustrated .\nregulators of gene expression generally stand in a complicated network ; likewise , mirnas themselves are coordinatively modulated by different effectors when carrying out basic functions .\nas we know , a growing body of mirnas shows development- and tissue - specific regulation mechanisms although a considerable amount of known mirnas are expressed universally in various tissues and species ( 45 ) .\naccordingly , it is inferred that accurate regulation networks may exist in order to regulate the biogenesis and functions of mirnas .\nit is noteworthy that the multiple steps in mirna biogenesis appear to be a cooperated procedure and their influences are already reported ( 46 ) .\nin addition , other factors , such as sequence - specific rna binding proteins with double - strand rna binding domains ( dsrbds ) , are also known to regulate and control the function of mirnas 47 . , 48 . , 49 .. herein , we mainly focused on additional mechanisms ( snp , rna editing , methylation and circadian clock ) that all play important roles in controlling the expression and function of mirnas .\nample evidence has emerged and supported the idea that single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , created by changes in dna sequences of mirna - coding genes or in an mirna - binding site in mrnas , are able to affect the biogenesis and function of mirna .\nmany mirna polymorphisms are shown to be associated with diseases , because a gain - of - function of an mirna polymorphism may recruit or enhance the combination of the mirna to the targets , thereby strengthen the regulation effects , such as tumor suppressor genes ; on the contrary , a loss - of - function may result in losing control of the mrnas especially those oncogenes and drug targets ( 50 ) . in the case of mir-146a ,\na common g / c polymorphism within the pre - mir-146a sequence decreased the generation of pre- and mature mir-146a and led to less efficient inhibition of target genes involved in the toll - like receptor and cytokine signaling pathway , which contribute to the genetic predisposition to papillary thyroid carcinoma ( 51 ) .\nrecently , sun and colleagues performed a large - scale genetic analysis of naturally occurring mirna polymorphisms and argued that a single base alteration even outside of the mature mirna sequence may profoundly impact on mirna generation and function ( 52 ) .\nadditionally , it is by - no - means negligible that snps in target sites of mrnas may also result in the escape of inhibition or degradation by an mirna ( 53 ) . taken together , snp is becoming a noticeable factor in regulating the biogenesis and functionality of mirnas .\nrna editing is a site - selective modification of rna molecules at post - transcriptional level to yield a product differing from the dna template .\napproximately 16% human pri - mirnas are subject to a - to - i editing ( 54 ) .\nknown a - to - i editing sites residing in the mature mirna sequences are listed in table 1 .\nmirna editing may represent a fine tuning process in mirna biogenesis at different steps , resulting in variations of target mrnas and providing another layer of regulatory controls within the complex network of rna - mediated gene functions ( figure 1 ) .\nit has recently been shown that , the pri - mirna transcripts of some mirnas are subject to post - transcriptional modification by a - to - i rna editing , which is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on rna ( adars ) 55 . , 56 . , 57 . , 58 . , 59 .. as in the case of mir-142 and mir-151 , a - to - i editing at specific positions blocks the drosha / dicer cleavage in the maturation of mirnas 57 . , 59 .. therefore , rna editing displays a micro - regulatory role in controlling the mirna - processing machinery .\nin addition , edited mirnas may silence a set of genes different from those targeted by the unedited mirnas , extending the functional scope of mirnas but increasing the complexity of analyses at the same time 60 .\n, 61 .. furthermore , rna editing contributes to the diversity of mirnas by generating different mature mirnas from identical mirna transcripts ( 62 ) .\nit is described that some mirna genes are affected by epigenetic inactivation due to aberrant hypermethylation , which is characterized as early and frequent events in cancer development 63 .\n, 69 .. the expression of mirna genes , especially those locating near cpg islands , tends to be affected readily by methylation 63 .\nhan and co - workers found that the expression of about 10% mirnas tested are regulated by dna methylation based on a comparative analysis on colon cancer cell line hct 116 with its derivative , a dna methyltransferase 1 and 3b double - knockout cell line , and they provided evidence that mirna expression is strictly dominated by dna methylation and partial methylation reduction is not sufficient for the recovery of mirna expression ( 71 ) .\nthe expression level of mir-370 in human malignant cholangiocytes is significantly down - regulated by the over - expression of interleukin-6 and up - regulated by the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine , indicating that interleukin-6 indirectly activates the expression of mir-370 by alerting the level of dna methyltransferase enzyme-1 and hasj4442 ( 72 ) .\ntwo components of the p53 network , mir-34b and mir-34c , are also epigenetically silenced in colorectal cancer due to the hypermethylation of neighboring cpg islands ( 73 ) .\nfurthermore , it is conceivable that dna methylation can affect the expression of transcription factors so that it may control the mirna expression in an indirect manner ( 71 ) .\nafter all , the mechanisms of methylation - dependent regulation of mirnas are of great significance and we are at the very beginning of fully understanding such mechanisms at molecular details . a minority of mirnas are found to be modulated in circadian rhythm regulation mechanisms .\nmir-219 is targeted by the clock and bmal1 complex ( 74 ) and mir-132 is induced by photic entrainment cues through a mapk / creb -

depth analyses have demonstrated that the repression effect of mirnas can be relieved when they are subject to different types of stress , such as amino acid deprivation , oxidative stress and synaptic stimulation 77 .\n, 78 . , 79 .. in other words , some mirnas , if not all , may interplay with their targets in a reversible manner . in addition\n, there are clues suggesting that mirnas may regulate other non - coding rnas at post - transcriptional levels , including their own primary transcripts , and the result supports the possibility that mirna regulatory cascades are not limited to protein - coding transcripts ( 80 ) . however , there are still enigmas to be uncovered\n. mirnas with incomplete base pairing to their targets usually repress their actions rather than promote simple degradation .\nwe are yet to know the fates of these mirnas , that is , after repressing their targets , what are the molecular mechanisms to get rid of these mirnas ?\nup to now , a large body of evidence supports the idea that mirnas are involved in a broad spectrum of biological progresses involving negative post - transcriptional gene regulation .\nbased on increasing numbers of specific mirna functional study , it is indispensable for us to construct a global view about mirna regulation mechanisms and understand mirna in different angles ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " micrornas ( mirnas ) are a class of short , endogenously -

origin influenza a virus subtype h1n1 has been declared as the first global influenza pandemic of the 21st century . as of july 4 , 2010 , over 18311 deaths in more than 214 countries have been confirmed ( http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_07_09/en/index.html ) .\ninfluenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family and are divided into three types , namely , a , b , and c. influenza a virus , in particular , represents a significant health risk to the public due to both its ability to spread rapidly among humans and being associated with major epidemic outbreaks .\ninfluenza virus is an enveloped virus containing eight segmented , single ( nonpaired ) , and negative sense rna strands that code for 11 proteins [ 6 , 7 ] , including two glycoproteins ( hemagglutinin ( ha ) , neuraminidase ( na ) ( also known as sialidase ) , two matrix proteins ( m1 and m2 ) , two nonstructural ( ns ) proteins ( ns1 and ns2 ) , nucleoprotein ( np ) , two polymerase basic proteins ( pb1 and pb2 ) , polymerase acidic protein ( pa ) , and basic polymerase 1 frame 2 protein ( pb1-f2 ) .\nviruses of the influenza type a are subtyped based on the ha and na , antigenic surface glycoproteins found on the viral envelope , which are essential for viral entry and replication in the infective cycle of influenza .\nthere are 16 hemagglutinin ( h1 to h16 ) and 9 neuraminidase subtypes ( n1 to n9 ) that have been identified .\nneuraminidases from influenza type a virus form two genetically distinct groups : group-1 containing n1 , n4 , n5 , and n8 subtypes\n, n7 , and n9 subtypes [ 920 ] . sialidase activity of the influenza neuraminidase cleaves the glycosidic linkage to sialic acid ( 1 ) on host cells and the surface of the viral particles to facilitate the spread of virions in the host .\ntherefore , sialidase activity is required for the efficient viral release , and inhibition of sialidase activity is proved to be effective in the treatment or prevention of influenza . in late 1960s , dana 2 ( 5-acetamido-2,6-anhydro-3,5-dideoxy - d - glycero- d - galacto - non-2-enonic acid , neu5ac2-en ) , a transition - state analogue , is identified as an effective first inhibitor of sialidase enzymes . using the advantage of structure - based drug design method , two potent sialidase inhibitors , zanamivir 3\n( relenza , glaxosmithkline ) and an ester prodrug oseltamivir 4 ( tamiflu , gilead / roche ) , were designed and developed for the prevention and the treatment of influenza and were complementing the widespread use of influenza vaccines [ 24 , 25 ] ( figure 1 ) .\nboth sialidase ( na ) enzyme inhibition and x - ray crystallography studies of these inhibitors also suggest that the strategy of designing an inhibitor of na that binds to the highly conserved active site of the na achieves the desired goal of activity against all influenza na subtypes , n1n9 , and influenza b viruses [ 26 , 27 ] . however , with use of these licensed drugs , several mortalities , severe allergic reactions , and neuropsychiatric events have been reported , particularly in japan .\nalso , the fda has issued a warning label for tamiflu after reports of serious psychiatric side effects in patients receiving the drug , especially in children .\nsome of the observed adverse effects have been speculated as a reason of nonselective endogenous human sialidase inhibition by these drugs , although no statistically significant relationship has been established till present [ 30 , 31 ] .\nfour types of human sialidases are known and have been classified based on their subcellular localization , namely , the intralysosomal sialidase ( neu1 ) , the cytosolic sialidase ( neu2 ) , the plasma membrane - associated sialidase ( neu3 ) , and the lysosomal or mitochondrial membrane - associated sialidase ( neu4 ) .\nhuman sialidases are involved in a wide variety of biological processes through modulating the sialoglycoconjugates .\nthey are implicated in various cellular events such as cell metabolism , cell differentiation , cell growth , and apoptosis including immune functions .\nhuman sialidases , although differ from the viral sialidases in their primary structure and enzymatic properties , show striking similarities in the tertiary structural aspects and active - site architecture .\ntherefore , active site - directed nonspecific inhibitors of viral sialidase could also potentially inhibit human sialidase isoforms .\nfor instance , inhibition of neu3 in normal subjects may contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms since neu3 is proved to be an important molecule in the neuronal differentiation . the above mentioned facts suggests that there is a significant need for viral sialidase selective inhibitors with other improved properties ( including increased efficacy and reduced sensitivity to resistance ) relative to the currently marketed drugs .\nthe structural analysis of various sialidase - dana complexes suggests that four main functional groups that bind to the enzyme active site are 2-carboxylate , 4-hydroxyl , 5-n - acetyl , and 6-glycerol moiety ( figure 2 ) .\nmore importantly , 2-carboxylate ( -c1o1ao1bh ) group is absolutely necessary for the inhibitory activity .\nit is well established that the arg triad in the immediate vicinity of the carboxylate group plays a key role in orienting and stabilizing various inhibitors [ 37 , 38 ] . in our previous work , we reported a series of amide - linked c9 modified dana analogues as human sialidase inhibitors , and structure - based methods were used to investigate the observed activity .\nresults showed that some of the c9 amide - linked hydrophobic analogues of dana are selective for human lysosomal sialidase ( neu1 ) . the mixed structure and sequence alignment of viral sialidase with human sialidases revealed that neu1 has a higher sequence similarity ( 34% ) as compared to other isoforms ( 2527% ) , and the active site architecture of neu1 is more closely related to viral sialidase than other isoforms though striking variations are present .\nin particular , near c9 of dana , the conserved e277 of viral sialidase that forms important h - bonds with o8 and o9 hydroxyl groups of dana is also conserved in neu1 with a chemically equivalent residue ( asp263 ) , while other isoforms are substituted with nonpolar amino acid residues ( figure 2 ) . considering this\n, we planned to evaluate certain c9 dana amides , ( i ) , against viral sialidases and compared their selectivity over human sialidases .\nherein , we report the viral sialidase inhibitory activities and complete experimental details of synthesis and screening of c9 amide - linked hydrophobic analogues.(i )\na set of c9 n - acyl neu5ac2en derivatives were synthesized according to the procedures previously described .\nthe viral sialidase inhibitory activities of compounds ( 514 ) were evaluated against three different strains of influenza a virus ( h1n1 , h3n2 , and h5n3 ) using dana 2 as a reference compound .\nresults expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) values are presented in table 1 together with the previously reported human sialidase inhibitory activities of compounds ( for 2 , 5 , and 8) .\nsome compounds demonstrate moderate to good inhibitory activities against viral sialidases with ic50 of lower than 100  m . moreover , most of the compounds show more activity against sialidase of h1n1 strain over other tested viral strains .\nthe substitution of the small groups by higher homologues at c9 amide position results in a substantial loss of inhibitory activity and might reflect a spatial restriction in the active site of viral sialidases .\nin particular , the bulky groups of compounds ( 6 , 7 , and 14 ) severely diminish the activity , and this effect becomes more evident with other viral sialidases of h3n2 and h5n3 .\nindeed , compounds 5 ( 22  m for h1n1 , 34  m for h3n2 , and 97  m for h5n3 ) and 8 ( 9  m for h1n1 , 16  m for h3n2 , and 98  m for h5n3 ) show ic50 values close to dana ( 1  m for h1n1 , 9  m for h3n2 , and 11  m for h5n3 ) and inhibit the viral sialidases with higher affinity as compared to other compounds in this series .\ninterestingly , the viral / human sialidase selectivity profiles of compounds 5 ( ic50 58  m for neu1 , > 1000  m for neu2 , > 1000  m for neu3 , and 580  m for neu4 ) and 8 ( 680  m for neu1 , > 1000  m for neu2 , > 1000  m for neu3 , and 825  m for neu4 ) are better than those of dana ( 143  m for neu1 , 43  m for neu2 , 61  m for neu3 , and 74  m for neu4 ) .\nthese data indicate that compounds 5 and 8 could be further explored for the design of viral sialidase selective inhibitors .  \na mixed structural - sequence analysis and molecular docking were performed to explain why there are notable differences in binding affinities and selectivities .\nthe crystal structure of h1n1 ( a / brevig mission/1/18 ) ( pdb code , 3b7e ) was selected as the representative for determining the information regarding spatial disposition discriminating residues .\nthe multiple - sequence alignments of the tested viral strains ( h1n1 [ acqp03468 ] , h3n2 [ acqp03475 ] , and h5n3 [ acqa6yj51 ] ) and 3b7e were performed ( figure 3 ) .\nthe best compound 8 was chosen to be docked into the dana 's binding site of h1n1 ( 3b7e ) , and then obtained protein - ligand complex was energetically minimized .\nwe can infer from figures 3 and 4 that the putative active site residues interacting with compound 8 are highly conserved in all three viral sialidases , except a striking difference at ser246 ( 3b7e ) and its neighboring residues .\nthis difference is positioned in the vicinity of c-9 of dana 's scaffold and could be a reason for differential interaction of the present series of compounds with their binding regions . taking a close look at the binding mode of c9 substituent of compound 8 in the active site of h1n1 , it can be seen that one out of two conserved h - bond interactions of dana with glu ( 276 in h1n1 ) is broken and a new h - bond is formed with ser246 ( h1n1 ) . in the case of h3n2 and h5n3 , this residue is substituted with a hydrophobic residue ala that can cause a loss of h - bond and a subsequent drop in the inhibitory activity as compared to h1n1 .\nthe cyclopropyl ring of compound 8 interacts with a fleck of hydrophobic surface mainly defined by the side chains of asn211 , ile222 , arg224 , ser246 , and pro227 . as seen in table 1 , the small structural differences at c9 substituents that likely interact with this hydrophobic surface had significant differences in the inhibitory activity .\nthe above mentioned observations indicate that cyclopropyl group can form optimal interactions , and even a slight increase in size of the substituent can probably cause repulsive interactions with this hydrophobic surface .\nalthough the difference is not significant , the slightly increased activity of compound 8 over compound 5 could be due to the conformational rigidity of the cyclopropyl group that is also proposed for its decreased activity against human sialidases as compared to dana .\nin summary , this study describes a set of c9 n - acyl neu5ac2en mimetics as viral sialidase selective inhibitors .\nthe results indicate that the cyclopropyl substituent at c9 shows an optimal inhibitory activity for the current series of compounds and also exhibits a better selectivity profile than the reference compound dana .\nmultiple sequence alignment and molecular docking studies give some possible explanations on the interaction of compound 8 with the viral sialidases .\nwe strongly believe that the information derived from present study could be potentially utilized for the design of selective viral sialidase inhibitors over human sialidases and such selective inhibitors are of interest in the context of the future development of anti - influenza agents with minimum or less adverse effects in influenza patients .\na total of 10 compounds ( 5-acetamido-9-acylamido-2,3,5,9-tetra deoxy - d - glycero - d- galacto - non-2-eno - pyranosonic acids ) ( 514 ) selected for viral sialidase screening in this study were prepared according to the procedure previously described .\n( the spectral data of compounds is given in the supplementary section available at doi:10.1155/2011/539245 ) .  \ninhibitory activities of compounds ( 514 ) against sialidase of influenza a viruses were assayed fluorometrically using 4-methylumbelliferyl n -

de - sac after instillation .\nthe general consensus in the literature is that schirmer i with anesthesia does not measure true basal secretion [ 67 ] .\nincomplete anesthesia ( including sensation of the lower lid ) and psychogenic variables often serve to maintain a level of reflex tearing after instillation of the anesthetic [ 69 ] .\nadditionally , use of anesthetic has been implicated in disruption of cell junctions which may increase surface staining leading to erroneous conclusions during the evaluation of surface integrity . as corneal and/or conjunctival staining\nis routinely performed after the schirmer test , the inclusion of anesthetic may inadvertently result in misclassification of the presence and/or severity of dry eye .\nwhether with or without the use of anesthetic , numerous review and research papers have documented high variability , low reproducibility and poor correlation with other signs and symptoms of dry eye [ 1116 ] .\nalthough some of the variability associated with the schirmer i test may be minimized in moderate to severe aqueous deficient dry - eyed individuals , poor reproducibility severely limits the utility of the this test as a means of quantifying efficacy relating to dry eye therapy . in an attempt to minimize variability , numerous variations of the schirmer test ( in addition to anesthetic use ) ,\nhave been proposed including closing the eyes , using dim light , reducing the test time and the use of different filter materials . to date , no such alteration in methodology has resulted in a consistent improvement in schirmer reproducibility or diagnostic sensitivity .\nadditional limitations associated with the schirmer test have been described in the past 20 years [ 11 , 16 ] . included in this list\nis the fact that the testing time ( 5 min ) is too long [ 17 , 18 ] ; the paper strip may absorb tears unevenly ( depending on tear composition ) ; there is potential for evaporative loss ; the test causes discomfort and there is no true agreement for lower  cut off  wetting length limits in non dry - eyed patients or those with dry eye disease .\nif we consider all the vagaries discussed above , it should not be surprising that there remains a lack of consensus as to what schirmer score truly is indicative of dry eye syndrome .\nscores collected without anesthesia ranging from 5 to < 10 mm and < 8 mm with anesthesia are generally regarded as abnormal , signifying the presence of dry eye .\nmuch of the difficulty in defining wetting limits for diagnostic purposes can be summarized by a statement paraphrased from cho    schirmer values are too variable such that no definite limit for normal tear production can be determined .\n despite significant effort , there have been only a very small number of studies that have found a wetting cut off point that is correlated with another sign or symptom of dry eye .\nfurthermore , the range of values is such that regardless of a cut off point , false negative and/or positive identification of dry - eyed subjects is common . despite the paucity of reproducible data ,\nthe recent dews 2007 report   has suggested a reasonable cutoff value of  5 mm in 5 min for a dry eye diagnosis .\nthe phenol red thread ( prt ) test was introduced in 1982   and was developed to overcome many of the disadvantages of the schirmer test as described in the previous section including high variability , poor reproducibility , and low sensitivity for detecting dry eyes .\nthe test consists of a cotton thread impregnated with phenol red which is ph sensitive .\nwhen wet with tears , which are slightly alkaline , the thread turns from yellow to red .\nthe  red  portion of the thread is analogous to wetting of the schirmer strip and the length of red color in mm is recorded .\nstandard clinical data suggests that for a 15-s test , wetting lengths should normally be between 9 and 20  mm .\nmethodologically , the prt test is similar to the schirmer test , although there are some potential advantages that include the fact that there is little to no sensation from the thread , thus less potential for reflex .\nfurthermore , the test time is only 15  s per eye , the eyes remain open and are free to blink , and no anesthetic is required [ 16 , 2024 ] . despite these potential advantages , the prt is used rarely in clinical practice or in clinical development .\ntwo possible reasons for this are that the threads are difficult to handle initially due to their light and flexible nature and the threads are only manufactured in japan , making their supply costly and often requiring special ordering . although the prt test is not a standard clinical test , its potential advantages over the schirmer i test have generated interest in assessing its reproducibility and utility .\nseveral studies have found the prt test to be more repeatable than the schirmer test ( with and without anesthestic ) as well as more reliable in diagnosing dry eye [ 20 , 2425 ] .\nchiang et al .   compared 66 normal eyes and 14 dry eyes ( de ) using both schirmer i and prt . in 28 eyes ,\nthe following data were reported : normal prt  =  20.3    8.7 mm vs de prt  =  8.1    8.0 mm ( p  <  0.005 ) ; normal schirmer  =  10.0    7.9 mm vs de schirmer  =  14.6    9.8 mm ( p  =  0.33 ) .\nbased on these data , the authors concluded that the likelyhood of a false positive was 3% using prt and 18% using schirmer .\nan estimate of the reproducibility of the measurements was achieved through comparison of data collected on two successive days .\npatel et al .   concluded that the prt test could accurately differentiate aqueous dry eyed subjects from non dry - eyed subjects , although in his study , the thread was left in place for 120  s. in this same study , it was concluded that the prt test could not differentiate between dry eye and non - dry eye if both aqueous and lipid deficient dry - eyed individuals were lumped together . from a limited number of studies\n, it generally appears that the prt outperforms the schirmer test in the areas of reproducibility and reliability .\nglobal data interpretation however must proceed with caution , as several of the studies addressing repeatability were performed on non dry - eyed subjects , thus calling into question the true utility of the findings with respect to use in a dry - eyed population .\nnichols et al . [ 13 , 26 ] analysis of reliability and correlation of clinical measurements of dry eye have found that positive correlations do exist between ( a ) schirmer and fluorescein staining , ( b ) prt and both fluorescein and rose bengal staining , and ( c ) schirmer and prt . what is disturbing , however , is that although these positive correlations were found , only 31% of dry eye patients had confirmatory tests for dry eye as evidenced by two positive tests out of the six possible tests performed to diagnose dry eye .\nthese tests included fluorescein staining , rose bengal staining , prt , schirmer , tear meniscus height and tear film break - up time ( tbut ) .\nthese finding highlight the poor correlation that exists between all the tests as well as the difficulty in selecting entry criteria for a therapeutic drug study in the dry eye patient population .\nsaleh   suggests that the poor correlation between tests is as a result of the fact that each test utilizes a different mechanism to assess the ocular surface .\ntherefore , due to the multifactorial nature of dry eye , many mechanisms do not apply to the individual dry - eye patient .\nsaleh   further demonstrated that in a cataract population being screened for surgery , neither schirmer nor prt results agreed with symptoms ( 28/103 patients were symptomatic of dry eye based on questionnaire ) and that prt results showed no correlation with schirmer results .\nin addition to clinical utility , the question that has surfaced repeatedly is  what does the prt actually measure ? \nnumerous studies now suggest that the prt measures a representation of fluid stored in the lower cul de sac plus a component of tear secretion ( basal and/or low grade reflex ) [ 16 , 2324 ] .\na true measure of reflex secretion would require an absorption capacity far in excess of what a prt is capable of .\nin addition , in 15  s , only approximately 0.5  l of tears or 7.5% of the average normal volume is collected , thus raising the question of how reliable an overall estimate of volume could be achieved with the prt test .\nit has been suggested that the ability of the prt to differentiate aqueous dry - eyed from non - dry - eyed subjects is due to the tests ability to first absorb the tears naturally present in the lacrimal lake and then continue to measure the replenishment of fluid into the lake as a result of basal flow and/or mild stimulation .\nsubjects with aqueous deficiency can not replenish their fluid as quickly , hence less wetting of the thread occurs . blades and patel   have argued that the length of the prt test be extended past 15 s as they and others have demonstrated that wetting is not linear and with the threads they employed , reached equilibrium in 120 s. further adding complexity to our understanding of  what is being measured  is the possibility that the composition of the tear fluid can influence wetting length .\nboth lipids and mucins can influence flow and it has been demonstrated that in comparison to migration of saline through a thread , variable tear composition likely increases the variability of both prt and schirmer measurements . increased test time may positively influence more than just differential tear composition and reflex tearing . it is argued that leaving the thread in for a longer time will increase the accuracy of the test .\nfor example , the measuring scale for prt has a resolution of 1  mm , thus if mean migration in 15  s  =  9.2  mm , then resolving power  =  ( 100    1/9.2)%  =  11% .\nif the test runs for 60  s and mean wetting is 18  mm , then resolving power reduces to ( 100    1/18)%  =  5.6% , thus increasing the ability to detect change and/or differences among test subjects . perhaps finding the time that provides the optimal balance between sufficient time for wetting versus minimal irritation ( causing reflex tearing ) is key . this may apply to both schirmer and prt tests .\nage and ethnic considerations may also be important in assessing the utility of functional testing for dry eye .\nseveral studies have demonstrated that prt wetting values for non - dry - eyed subjects are influenced by age ( prt reduces as age increase ) and by race [ prt values are lower in american caucasians compared to japanese ( living in japan ) ] [ 20 , 24 ] . in summary , although rarely used , the prt may offer an advantage over the schirmer test with respect to increased measurement reproducibility . to this end , it may provide both better diagnostic utility as well as serve as a more meaningful tool for therapeutic drug evaluation .\nthe prt test , however , still demonstrates variability and compromised reproducibility due to patient variation in the volume , depth , and shape of the lacrimal lake , the temperature of the environment in which the test is performed and the variation in tear composition among patients . additionally , the threads are difficult to handle and insert thus necessitating appropriate training .\nfurther research on timing of the test and perhaps the use of a closed eye   may further refine reproducibility .\nas noted above , neither the schirmer nor the prt appear ideal for the accurate and reproducible quantitation of tear production . however , alternative , more dynamic methods have been established utilizing the rate of disappearance of a tracer as the functional readout .\nlacrimal scintigraphy is one such method , which involves the application of a radioactive tracer such as technetium 99 ( 99 m tc ) into the lower marginal tear strip [ 28 , 29 ] .\nthe distribution of the tracer is monitored by a gamma counter , and the rate of change or transit time of the tracer through the system provides an estimate of tear turnover .\nalthough various quantitative algorithms have been proposed for this approach , the widespread clinical use of a radioisotope in humans is both undesirable and impractical .\nthus , methods utilizing fluorescence rather than radioactive decay were developed to enable assessment of tear turnover .\nfollowing topical ocular application , fluorescein sodium is thought to be distributed homogenously on the corneal surface and conjunctival sac after several blinks .\nimmediately thereafter , tears containing fluorescein are removed by flow and are replaced by fresh tears not containing fluorescein .\nthe measurement of fluorescein disappearance via fluorophotometry or other fluorescein clearance tests is used to determine tear turnover which is defined as the percentage decrease of fluorescein concentration in tears per unit of time ( % minute ) .\nbasal tear turnover , defined as the tear turnover at the lowest level of reflex tear production possible under physiologic conditions , is then utilized as an indirect quantitative assessment of tear production .\nearly studies with in vivo fluorophotometry utilized a modified slit lamp ; however , commercially available instruments ( i.e. , the fluorotron master ) have greatly aided in the standardization of clearance measurements .\ntypically , 1 to 5  l of sodium fluorescein are applied to the ocular surface and fluorescein concentration is measured at various intervals for a duration of 15 to 30  min [ 3033 ] .\nthe change is rate of decay of fluorescence is calculated for the entire test duration .\ntypically , a biphasic decay is observed , with the first 5  min representing initial reflex tearing after which ( 5  min outward ) , basal conditions of secretion are represented .\nit is this second phase of the curve that is used to extrapolate basal tear turnover .\ntear turnover data can then be transformed to flow and/or volume estimates . as alternative approaches to fluorophotometry , two indirect or ex vivo measures have been proposed .\nthe first , introduced by xu and tsubota , is a modification of the schirmer test with anesthesia .\nfive minutes after co - application of fluoroescein and anesthetic , schirmer strips are inserted .\nthe length of wetting is recorded after 5  min and the intensity of strip staining is compared to a standard color plate .\nalthough clinically practical , this approach has been criticized for being semi - quantitative at best .\nthus , as a potential improvement , afonso et al .   described a method where following instillation of fluorescein , tears were collected with a porous polyester rod .\ndata reported in the literature using each of these techniques suggest that measurement of tear clearance provides a more reliable and objective endpoint for the diagnosis of dry eye compared to schirmer or prt [ 3039 ]\ntear film fluorophotometry remains predominantly a research tool due to the cost of the instrumentation required to perform such studies .\nfirst , any disturbance of the corneal surface , such as occurs in dry eye , may alter the corneal uptake of fluorescein from the tear film .\nthis can result in a change to the monoexponential decay rate of fluorescein used in the calculation of tear production [ 30 , 38 ] .\ntherefore , in clinical studies used to asses the efficacy of drugs to treat dry eye , an improvement of the ocular surface may in and of itself change the measured rate of tear clearance which could be falsely attributed to the effect of the test drug .\nadditional sources of error in tear film fluorophotometry may arise from reflex lacrimation , changes in tear film thickness , and corneal autofluorescence . with respect to the alternative measures of tear clearance ,\nadditionally , expensive instrumentation is required for quantitation of fluorescein extracted from the polyester rods and color comparison of dyed schirmer strips is complicated by the fact that fluorescein intensity will be affected by the length of strip wetting .\napplicable to all tear clearance methods are anatomical influences ( lid laxity , blink abnormalities , functional tear outflow obstruction ) and optimal timing and dye volume variables . the last point to address\nis the fact that tear turnover measured by any of these tests is not a direct or independent measure of tear production [ 7 , 30 ] . as described by afonso et al .\n, delayed tear clearance occurs in both aqueous tear deficient dry eye as well as \nthis group and others have suggested that tear clearance values may correlate well with ocular irritation symptoms and/or inflammation of the ocular surface [ 7 , 32 ] , but whether or not true measures of production or volume can be made remains to be tested .\nas evidenced by the dews 2007   report , considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the epidemiology , pathophysiology , and diagnosis of dry eye .\nclinically , it appears clear that no single test is capable of repeatedly differentiating dry - eyed from non - dry - eyed individuals . in this review , we have highlighted the fact that although tests such as the schirmer , prt , and fluorophotometry may all be employed to assess clinical endpoints , numerous variables associated with each may contribute to poor test reproducibility and poor correlation to the clinical improvement that accompanies the use of a therapeutic agent .\nalthough unconventional , the prt appears to offer the next best accuracy and reproducibility followed by the schirmer test .\nit is particularly disconcerting that of all these tests , few if any correlate with each other to a significant degree . from the perspective of therapeutic development , these diagnostic shortcomings translate into a significant obstacle as evidenced by the fact that regulatory agency approval of a therapeutic agent that improves both a sign and symptom endpoint has been elusive . due to the limitations of obtaining and measuring select endpoints\nto assess tear function regardless of the test used , it is reasonable to ask if the main reason we do not yet have an approved drug to treat dry eye syndrome is because a given drug simply lacks clinical robustness , or rather , because there are significant quantitative limitations in the methods currently used to demonstrate the clinical robustness of a particular drug ?\nof concern is that regardless of the tear function test used , it appears that none of these tests may ultimately possess the reproducibility , sensitivity , and/or robustness to serve as a reliable and reproducible quantitative assessment of tear volume .\ncontinued efforts in method development will surely be required in order to validate and characterize tear function endpoints used in clinical trials to support the approval of a drug for dry eye therapy ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the successful development of a therapeutic agent targeting treatment of dry eye syndrome necessitates the demonstration of drug efficacy for both sign and symptom endpoints . as numerous therapeutic strategies incorporate a secretagogue function into their overall mechanism of action , the quantitative assessment of tear production serves as a logical endpoint to anchor \n  sign  efficacy . \n although several methods including the schirmer , the phenol red thread and tear clearance tests exist , their utility in clinical evaluations of novel therapeutics is unclear . \n the purpose of this review is to summarize findings and conclusions describing the performance of each of these tests so as to gain insight into which , if any , is most applicable for use in discovering new dry eye therapeutics .

decreases [ 56 , 57 ] .\nthe analysis of the available literature on the use of rituximab in treating patients with pv is not only difficult but restrictive , as a direct consequence of the significant limitations of the data\n. therefore , interpretation of the data analysis must be done in the light and perspective of these limitations .\non the contrary , these limitations are of significant benefit , because they will help in the design of future studies , and focus on elements of the pharmacodynamics of rituximab therapy .\nsome of these limitations are as follows : the data come from multiple sources ; there is a significant lack of uniformity in the selection of the patients , in defining their severity or extent of disease , and in identifying failed treatment before rituximab ; the lack of an objective scoring system makes changes or responses difficult to evaluate numerically ; the more concerning aspect is the limited follow - up provided by most authors , this becomes an important issue because significant side effects and relapses can occur several months after the discontinuation of rituximab therapy .\nas rituximab is a b cell depletion therapy , many authors have not provided any data on b cell levels and the changes in autoantibody levels .\nnone of the studies provide any rationale or scientific basis for the use of the lymphoma or ra protocols in treating patients with pv .\nthe response of patients to rituximab using the lymphoma protocol or ra protocol has been described in the results section .\nthe total number of patients treated by the lymphoma protocol and its modification was 180 .\nthe length of follow - up for patients in the lymphoma protocol was a mean of 15.44  months ( range 141  months ) and 21.04  months ( range 8.3529  months ) for the ra protocol .\na complete remission occurred in 66.66% of patients on the lymphoma protocol and 75% in the ra protocol .\nthis would suggest that both protocols are effective in producing clinical remissions during an 18-month follow - up . using the lymphoma protocol during this period , 11.11% of these patients are off therapy and 33.33% are on therapy .\nin contrast , in the ra protocol , 53.26% are off therapy and 17.4% are on therapy .\nthis apparent difference is partly due to the fact that the number of patients in whom the presence or absence of therapy while in complete remission is not mentioned in 22.22% of the patients in the lymphoma protocol , but only in 4.34% of the patients in the ra protocol .\ninterestingly , a partial response was observed in 12.78% of patients in the lymphoma protocol , but 23.91% of the patients in the ra protocol .\nof significant interest is the fact that there were no nonresponders in patients treated with the ra protocol compared to 3.9% in the lymphoma protocol .\nthe relapse rates were 22.78% in the lymphoma protocol and 35.87% in the ra protocol .\nthe incidence of serious infections was 3.9% in the lymphoma protocol but 15.21% in the ra protocol .\nthe mortality rate in the lymphoma protocol was 2.22% and 1.09% in the ra protocol .\nit is thus clear that there are significant and remarkable differences in the patient responses between the two protocols .\nthe data analysis did not provide clear indications for specific reasons that may account for these differences .\npreliminary observations would suggest that while the use of the lymphoma protocol produces a lower response rate , there is a lower rate of recurrences and serious infections but a higher mortality rate .\npatients treated by the ra protocol had higher response rates , a larger number of infections , but a lower mortality rate\n. this could be partly due to the fact that more patients were on corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents as concomitant therapy in the lymphoma protocol , thus adding to the degree and duration of prolonged immune suppression . to serve the best interests of the patient\n, it is useful and relevant to determine what purpose the lymphoma and ra protocols serve in their respective diseases .\nthe use of rituximab in lymphoma patients has a duration of response of a median of 12  months ( range 1113.4  months ) after which relapses frequently occur .\na median progression - free survival of 18  months and a 5-year relapse free survival of 28% was reported .\nthe most relevant use of rituximab comes from a 3-year progression - free survival study in which patients were given cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone - like chemotherapy with or without rituximab and the 3-year survival rates were 93% and 84% , respectively . therefore , to obtain the benefit of rituximab in lymphoma patients , the addition of other chemotherapeutic agents is required , and can be best measured in 3-year survival rates .\nthe use of rituximab in ra is still a matter of debate and discussion . between 2006 and 2011 , 5,903 patients , who were reported in eight different trials , were treated [ 6168 ] .\nthe benefits of rituximab are measured by the american college of rheumatology s 20% , 50% and 70% improvement criteria [ 6168 ] .\nthe only statistically significant dose regime was two cycles of 1,000  mg of rituximab over 48  weeks that achieved an american college of rheumatology improvement of 20% .\nthe rituximab consensus expert committee in 2011 stated that the optimal treatment paradigms have not yet been defined .\nrecently , two extremely different treatment options have been suggested . in the treatment to target protocol\n, rituximab is given to keep the disease activity score at 2.6 or less whether clinically needed or not .\nhowever , at the present time , there is no protocol that provides prolonged and sustained remission in ra .\ntherefore , it is unclear how many cycles are required to keep patients symptom free , prevent joint destruction , or can be safely given in any defined period .\nfurthermore , ra patients usually receive rituximab with methotrexate concomitantly and often additional prednisone [ 6168 ] .\npv treated by the ra protocol needed multiple infusions to treat recurrent relapses [ 52 , 53 ] .\nthe objectives of treating patients with pv are different from those with lymphoma or ra .\nthe optimal treatment for pv is one in which the disease is controlled , relapses are prevented , and the long - term sustained clinical remission without continued treatment can be achieved . in patients with pv and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid ,\nthis combination of rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin allowed for the discontinuation of previous systemic corticosteroids and isas and produced sustained clinical remissions .\npresently , the indications for using rituximab could be as follows.failure of conventional therapy for minimally 6  months.when conventional therapy has failed , or produced significant and catastrophic side effects , or is contraindicated , then intravenous immunoglobulin may be used .active or latent infections are a definitive contraindication.before initiating rituximab therapy , the goals and the endpoint should be discussed .\nthe long - term side effects of rituximab in patients with pv are not yet known .\npatients and their families should be advised of these facts.as clinical response may be faster with rituximab compared to conventional therapy , patients should be advised to return at frequent intervals for the early detection of possible recurrences and also for monitoring of late - onset side effects .\nfailure of conventional therapy for minimally 6  months . when conventional therapy has failed , or produced significant and catastrophic side effects , or is contraindicated ,

glutamyl transpeptidase were measured .\ninformation on cigarette smoking ( smoking status and smoking amount [ cigarettes / day and packs / year ] ) and alcohol intake was obtained from self - reported questionnaires .\npacks / year was calculated as smoking amount ( cigarettes / day ) divided by 20 ( cigarettes / pack ) and multiplied by smoking period .\nserum pops were measured in 0.51  ml samples of peripheral venous blood from each participant collected at the health examination after 12  h of fasting .\nserum samples were stored at  70  c and analyzed after thawing and homogenization .\nwe measured 33 pcbs and 19 ocps as individual chemicals and used analytical methods for pops used in previous research .\ninternal standard materials for refinement were added to the sample , stirred for 1520  s , and left for 15  min .\nthe mixture was then added to 1  ml ultrapure water and stirred . to remove air ,\nafter air was released for 30  min , ultrapure water was added again . to analyze the amount of pops in 0.51  ml of human blood , a solid - phase extraction method was used to simultaneously pretreat pcbs and ocps . for efficient extraction of all organic materials except for soluble materials , and to remove c18 cartridge and fats , an nh2 cartridge was used . in the extracted solvent\n, the sample was refined with silica - gel ( 1  g ) and florisil ( 0.5  g ) cartridge to remove interfering substances , using 50% dcm / n - hexane 16  ml as the elution solvent .\nbecause the refinement efficiency or recovery factor differs by the amount of elution solvent used , the adequate amount of elution solvent was determined through a fraction test .\nafter that , the elution solution was collected in a glass tube and condensed to below 1  ml using a nitrogen concentrator at temperatures below 35  c and pressure of 810 psi .\ninternal standard materials were added using a syringe and included nitrogen gases condensed to roughly 50100 l . a gas chromatograph\n( 6890 series ; agilent , palo alto , ca , usa ) and high resolution mass spectrometry ( jms-800d ; jeol , tokyo , japan ) were used for analyses . to ensure reliable results , we performed a base experiment by repeatedly measuring the same pool of serum every batch ( 20 samples ) whenever the samples were analyzed .\nin addition , we confirmed the coefficient of variation ( cv ) for each chemical and identified the linearity of the calibration - curve . the same method of validation ( n  =  20 ) was used in two independent laboratories to verify the suitability of the analysis method .\nthe detection limit was calculated by spiking using 25 times the expected detection limit and then multiplied by 3.143 ( t - value , a  =  99% ) , the standard deviation derived from seven repetitions .\nthe detection limit was 0.040.15  ng / g lipid for pcbs and 0.250.94  ng / g lipid for ocps .\nwe selected 10 pcbs ( pcb 52 , pcb 101 , pcb 105 , pcb 118 , pcb 138 , pcb 153 , pcb 156 , pcb 157 , pcb 167 , and pcb 180 ) and 6 ocps ( -hexachlorocyclohexane , p , p-dichlorophenyldichloroethylene , cis -

smokers and current smokers in the ever - smoker group and classified smoking status as never - smoker and ever - smoker for comparison .\nin addition , we stratified subjects by gender in accordance with a previous study showing that the association between dioxin body burden and tobacco smoking is different for men and women .\nstudent 's t - test and chi - square test were used for comparison between never - smokers and ever - smokers by sex . in women , only 8 subjects of 18\never - smokers had available information on smoking amount ( cigarettes / day ) ; therefore , we only analyzed the relationship between pops and smoking amount in men .\nthe smoking amount for men was divided into two groups ( < 15 cigarettes / day and 15 cigarettes / day ) according to the median value .\nwe categorized pop as high or low using a threshold of 75% for logistic regression analyses .\ncut - off levels of high or low pops are presented in etable  1 .\ntherefore , we classified pops as dioxin - like pcbs that interact with ahr ( mono - ortho - substituted planar pcb and congeners 105 , 118 , 156 , 157 , and 167 ) , and non - dioxin - like pcbs ( congeners 52 , 101 , 138 , 153 , and 180 ) according to their toxicological and chemical properties .\nwe also summed the concentrations of dioxin - like pcbs , non - dioxin - like pcbs , total pcbs , and ocps to calculate the concentration of the pops mixture and examined the relationship between the pops ( sum of dioxin - like pcbs , sum of non - dioxin - like pcbs , total pcbs , and total ocps ) in each analysis .\nthe pop concentrations did not satisfy a normal distribution , so a non - parametric test was used .\nthe mann -

glutamyl transpeptidase , and alcohol intake .\nthis study demonstrated that serum pop concentrations were positively associated with smoking status and smoking amount in members of the korean general population who had health examinations . among women , the levels of pcbs and trans - nonachlordane were significantly higher in ever - smokers than in never - smokers , while male ever - smokers were significantly associated with only pcb 157 , which is a dioxin - like pcb .\nthese results are partially consistent with those of some previous studies . in a study conducted among norwegian women ,\nsmoking was significantly associated with higher levels of pcbs , p , p-dde , and -hch in breast milk .\nalso , a previous small study of a german population ( n  =  80 ) showed that children born to smoking mothers had higher pop concentrations than children of nonsmoking families . on the other hand , some researchers have reported negative associations between pops and smoking . in a short report evaluating the relationship between tobacco smoking and dioxin accumulation in belgium ,\nserum dioxin and coplanar pcbs were lower in current female smokers but higher in current male smokers than in never - smokers .\nthis inconsistency has also been observed in some other studies . while greenland male residents were positively correlated with ocps and plasma cotinine ( ng / ml ) in one study , statistically significant associations with ocps and male\n, we only found significant positive associations between pcbs and male ever - smokers , while no association was observed in women . increased pop concentrations\nmay be associated with enzymes of the p-450 cytochrome oxidase system , including cyp1a1 , cyp1a2 , and phenobarbital - cyp , which metabolize pops , nicotine , and nicotine 's breakdown products .\nconstituents from cigarette smoke , such as cd and co , influence the activity of the enzymes , and cd from cigarettes was reported to stimulate pcb uptake in quail . in our study , the risk of high pop concentrations was lower in the group that smoked 15 cigarettes / day than in the < 15 cigarettes / day group ( table  3 ) . although the difference was not statistically significant , the lower risk of high pop concentrations in heavy smokers ( who smoked more than 15 cigarettes / day ) may be due to the strong stimulation of dioxin biotransformation by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) or other chemicals in cigarette smoke .\nsome studies indicated that the compounds contained in cigarette smoke have affinity for aryl hydrocarbon receptors ( ahr ) and could be potent inducers of cytochrome p450 enzymes .\npops undergo enzymatic hydroxylation , which involves several cytochrome p-450 enzymes to varying extents , and the pops bind to the ahr to upregulate the activity of cyp1a . additionally , cyp2b enzymes metabolize ortho - substituted pcb , including mono - ortho pcb .\nupregulation of these enzymes causes receptor binding that results in an increase in the distribution of pops to the liver from the central compartment .\nin addition , a certain amount of smoking may affect metabolism of pops in the body , and the metabolic ability of pops by smoking may differ by individual . to date , obvious causes of inconsistency in the associations between pops and smoking amount were not revealed . in women , more strong positive associations between pops and smoking were shown than in men .\nthis gender difference may be due to the low metabolic ability of pops in women compared to men . in this study , age ,\nalcohol consumption , and ggt influenced the association between pops and smoking ( etable  3 ) .\nthis could be because age may be one of the major factors of pops accumulation .\nalso , alcohol consumption and ggt levels are related to liver function , so they may affect pops metabolism .\nwe propose that cigarette smoking leads to the bioaccumulation of pops through the action of cytochrome p-450 , one of the hepatic microsomal enzymes .\nhowever , as smoking frequency increases , cytochrome p-450 may trigger some metabolizing action by the pops .\nthese interactions between pops and smoking should be further studied through a large - scale cohort study and through animal experiment .\nfirst , we measured pops concentrations in human samples directly within the korean population rather than using a survey to collect exposure data .\nsecond , we analyzed the relation between serum pops and smoking using smoking amount ( cigarettes / day ) as well as smoking status according to gender .\nthird , 32 pcbs and 19 ocps were analyzed , and associations were observed between a variety of pops and smoking .\nfirst , due to the nature of cross - sectional studies , it is difficult to describe the cause of the relationship between pops and smoking .\nsecond , we could not evaluate female smokers with smoking amount because of the limited sample size .\nthird , self - reported smoking habits may not be accurate , so further studies need to include biological biomarkers , such as cotinine , in order to represent more exact information about smoking habits .\nfurther study to clarify inconsistencies in the relations between pops and smoking amount and gender is needed .\nour results suggest that pop concentrations may be higher in smokers than in never - smokers and that smoking is probably a confounding variable in studies of pops .\nadditional in  vivo and in  vitro experimental studies , as well as larger prospective studies in humans , would help to elucidate the relationship between pops and smoking .\nthis research was supported by grants ( 13162mfds891 and 15162mfds631 ) from the ministry of food and drug safety in 2014 ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " backgroundstudies on the associations between persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) and smoking according to gender and smoking amount ( cigarettes / day ) are limited , and the results regarding the relationship between pops and smoking are not completely consistent across studies.objectivesthe smoking rate in korea is one of the highest among the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) countries . \n we investigated the association between serum concentrations of pops and cigarette smoking in koreans by smoking status ( never -

client post processing software were graded very high at 8 out of 10 .\nin the background portion , meenan et al.1 pose a number of challenges of clinical use of thin - slice data sets .\nfirst , the storage space required and cost - effective storage are mentioned . in our experience ,\nthe storage of all data is easily possible as long as you are capable of purchasing your storage space cost - effectively without high markup of the pacs vendor because of the dedicated use of the storage space .\nthese requirements are high , but by having a dedicated radiology network segment with a 1-gb / s network speed the storage of the data and review within radiology is not a problem . for 3d processing , the use of a thin - client solution effectively decreases the required network bandwidth and the limitation to series with a maximum of 300 slices of the forward to the enterprise web - server further decreases the required bandwidth outside radiology .\nfurthermore , the transition of pacs viewers from thick to thin client solutions using wavelet compression techniques will further decrease the bandwidth requirements .\nthe advantage of using one pacs storage system that includes all available data with a dedicated and fast network eliminates the requirement for workflow strategies .\nthe value of applying 3d rendering techniques to ct and mri data has been described frequently . although discussion has started on the integration of these techniques into the normal workflow , the main drawback of most current implementations remains that the rendering is performed on dedicated , stand alone , 3d work stations . especially with the arrival of digital reporting , rendering must be integrated into the normal radiological workflow .\nusing this set - up , the availability of thin - slice data sets is transparent to the users .\nbecause all data are stored in one archive permanently and readily available everywhere , only one work station is required for both normal pacs viewing and advanced 3d viewing , and workflow strategies do not have to be implemented ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " current developments in storage solutions , pacs , and client -

then , total rna and protein were extracted from cells for analysis of trb3 , tgf-1 , and perk1/2 expression and culture medium was collected for measurement of concentration of collagen types i and iv .\ncells were replated and transfected in 6-well plates with 150  l opti - mem ( invitrogen , ca ) and 1.5  l / well lipofectamine 2000 ( invitrogen , ca ) with 20  pmol sirna and its controls .\nthe sense and antisense sequences of the primers were 5-gcacagaguacaccugcaatt-3 and 5-uugcagguguacucugugctt-3. as a negative control , we used randomly mixed sequences of trb3 sirna , 5-uucuccgaacgugucacgutt-3 , and 5-acgugacacguucggagaatt-3. the effect of sirna knockdown of trb3 on the expression of tgf-1 and collagen types i and iv was evaluated by western blot analysis or elisa at 48  h. all rnai experiments were repeated at least 3 times .\ng total rna was reverse - transcribed in a 20  ml volume containing 0.5  mg oligo - dt primer , 1  ml dntp mixture , 1.25  ml rnase inhibitor , and 4  u reverse transcriptase .\nreal - time quantitative pcr involved the sybr - based method in a 20  ml reaction in a roche light - cycler .\nreaction specificity was confirmed by analyzing melting curves and by electrophoresis on 2.0% agarose gel analysis of products .\nthe relative change in gene expression was analyzed by the 2 method and normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene -actin .\nthe protein extracts were separated on 10% sds - page then transferred to pvdf membranes , and blocked in tbst with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 2  h. the blots were incubated with antibodies for trb3 ( 1  :  200 ) , tgf-1 ( 1  :  200 ) , perk1/2 ( 1  :  2000 ) , erk1/2 ( 1  :  1000 ) , and -actin ( 1  :  1000 ) overnight at 4c , washed , and then incubated with goat anti - rabbit antibody ( 1  :  10000 ) at room temperature for 1  h. protein bands were analyzed by use of alphaview sa software .\nsoluble collagen types i and iv proteins were determined by elisa kits according to the manufacturer 's protocol .\nthe kits for mouse collagen types i and iv were species - specific and sensitive up to 1000 , 10 , and 20  ng / ml . all concentrations of proteins were normalized to the total protein amount .\ngroups were compared by one - way anova and correlation analysis involved pearson correlation coefficient . statistical analysis involved spss v17.0 for windows ( spss inc . , chicago , il ) .\nthe blood glucose results for control mice remained stable , whereas dn mice showed hyperglycemia .\nlevels of uae , scr , and bun and body weight were higher for db / db mice than age - matched controls ( p < 0.05 , p < 0.01 ) ( table 2 ) .\nmesangial matrix expansion and mesangial area were wider for dn than control mice . at 25 weeks\n, dn mice showed diffuse and nodular mesangial sclerosis ( figure 1(a ) ) , and the area of mesangium matrix and basement membrane was increased ( figure 1(b ) ) as was the relative fibrosis area ( figure 1(c ) ) .\ntrb3 was expressed mainly in the nucleus of intrinsic glomerular cells and tubular epithelial cells ( figure 2(a ) ) .\nthe mrna and protein expression of trb3 and tgf-1 were higher in dn than control mice from 20 weeks and increased with time ( figures 2(b ) and 2(c ) ) .\nthe protein level of trb3 was positively correlated with tgf-1 level ( r = 0.944 , p < 0.01 ) and renal interstitial fibrosis ( r = 0.857 , p < 0.05 in dn mice ) . to confirm the effect of glucose on the expression of trb3 ,\nthe mrna level of trb3 was increased within 12  h after hg stimulation and peaked at 48  h ( p < 0.01 , versus ng ; figure 3(a ) ) .\ntrb3 protein level was increased under hg at 12 , 24 , and 48  h ( figure 3(b ) ) .\nthis increase also peaked at 48  h ( p < 0.05 , versus ng ) .\nthus , hg can upregulate the expression of trb3 in mmcs . as compared with ng , hg time - dependently\nincreased both the mrna and protein expression of tgf-1 and collagen type iv ( figure 4 ) within 48  h and 12  h , respectively , for mrna and for both within 48  h for protein ( p < 0.01 , versus ng ) .\nhowever , collagen type i expression did not change under any conditions within 48  h ( data not shown ) .\ntherefore , hg increased tgf-1 and collagen type iv secreted from cultured mmc cells . to verify the effect of glucose on the activation of the erk1/2 mapk pathway in mmcs , cells were cultured in ng medium and then stimulated with hg or hm for various times .\nthe level of perk1/2 increased during the first 6  h ( p < 0.01 , versus ng ) after hg stimulation and peaked at 24  h ( p < 0.01 , versus ng ) ( figure 5(a ) ) .\ntherefore , hg can activate the erk1/2 pathway in mmcs . to confirm the effect of trb3 on this pathway , we transfected trb3 sirna into mmcs exposed to hg medium for 24  h and evaluated perk1/2 levels .\nexpression of fam increased at 6  h and peaked at 48  h ( figure 6(a ) ) . to test the efficacy of the selected sirna sequence\n, we measured the protein level of trb3 after 48  h transfection with trb3 sirna .\ntrb3 protein expression was lower in mmcs with trb3 sirna than in cells with control sirna ( p < 0.05 , versus ng + nc ) ( figure 6(b ) ) .\nperk1/2 expression was decreased in mmcs transfected with trb3 sirna ( p < 0.05 , versus hg + nc ; figure 5(b ) ) .\nthe expression of perk1/2 was markedly reduced by blocking erk1/2 mapk signaling by a specific erk inhibitor ( pd98059 , 10  mol / l ) ( figure 5(b ) ) .\nthe mrna and protein levels of tgf-1 and collagen type iv were decreased with the erk1/2 pathway blocked ( figures 7(a)7(d ) , p < 0.01 versus hg ) as was the perk1/2 level ( figure 5(b ) , p < 0.01 versus hg ) , which suggests that hg can regulate tgf-1 and collagen type iv through the erk1/2 mapk pathway . the protein expression of trb3 was markedly increased after blocking the erk1/2 mapk pathway ( figure 7(e ) , p < 0.01 versus hg ) .\nthis finding indicates a possible feedback regulation between trb3 and some downstream cytokines of erk1/2 mapk .\nhere , we found augmented expression of trb3 in kidneys of dn mice , which was positively related to tgf-1 expression and renal interstitial fibrosis .\nhg upregulated the expression of trb3 , tgf-1 , collagen type iv , and phosphorylated - erk1/2 mapk in mmcs . after inhibiting trb3 with trb3 sirna ,\nthe hg - induced level of perk1/2 mapk was attenuated and hg - induced expression of tgf-1 and collagen type iv decreased .\nmoreover , the protein expression of trb3 was increased after blocking the erk1/2 mapk pathway .\ntrb3 may be involved in dn by regulating the fibrosis cytokine tgf-1 and collagen type iv via erk1/2 mapk signaling .\ntribbles was first discovered to regulate drosophila embryogenesis , and it has the same location as the type 2 diabetes gene , so trb3 may have a natural link with diabetes . compared with wild - type mice , db / db diabetic mice were found to have increased trb3 mrna and protein expression in liver ; trb3 expression increased in the db / db mouse liver promoted blood glucose and increased glucose tolerance .\nwe examined the expression of trb1 , trb2 , and trb3 in the dn mouse kidney and found only trb3 expressed differently between dn and control groups , so trb3 could be a potential cytokine to widen the current knowledge of dn .\nour further study revealed that the mrna and protein levels of trb3 were higher in the dn than normal kidney , which was also positively correlated with tgf-1 protein level and content of collagen .\nprevious study showed that trb3 was positively correlated with kidney tissue fibrosis , which may play a role in promoting the progression of fibrosis by inducing the transformation between epithelial and mesenchymal tissue .\ntherefore , trb3 may be involved in dn by inducing interstitial fibrosis , in which tgf-1 plays a key role .\nwe wondered about the role of trb3 in the fibrosis of dn and the relationship between trb3 and tgf-1 .\nseveral studies supported that trb3 may function as a scaffold protein to control mapk activity [ 10 , 16 , 17 ] . among the several mapk signal pathways ,\nthe erk1/2 pathway is activated under hg in mesangial cells , followed by the complicated synthesis of tgf-1 .\nthe activation of the erk1/2 pathway is necessary for hg - induced production of tgf-1 and connective tissue growth factor ( ctgf ) in mmcs .\ntherefore , we focused on the erk mapk pathway . silencing trb3 decreased erk1/2 activation , followed by decreased mrna and protein levels of tgf-1 and collagen type iv in mmcs , so trb3 may participate in renal fibrosis of dn by upregulating tgf-1 and collagen type iv in mmcs via erk mapk signaling . to our knowledge\n, our study is the first to reveal the interaction between trb3 , erk1/2 , and tgf-1 in renal tissue of dn .\nrecently , trb3 was found stimulated in diabetic kidneys , regulated by the er stress marker chop , and inhibited the podocyte expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , which first suggested that trb3 plays a protective role in diabetic kidney disease .\nthese findings that differ from our results may be due to cell specificity ; we used mesangial cells , but the previous study used podocytes .\nnumerous cytokines may interact through different pathways , and different signal pathways may have  crosstalk .\nso , the role of trb3 in dn can also be studied from other signal pathways .\ntrb3 plays a role in the pathogenesis of dn by participating in insulin resistance , functioning as a negative modulator of akt [ 9 , 22 , 23 ] .\nanother study showed that trb3 may cause renal cell apoptosis by participating in the nf-b pathway and thus participate in the process of renal fibrosis in dn [ 24 , 25 ] .\nthere must be some interactions between erk , akt , nf-b , smad3 , and other unknown pathways .\nmore detailed and systemic studies are needed to establish the complete theory on trb3 involved in dn . in this study\n, we found that the expression of trb3 increased after blocking the erk1/2 mapk pathway , which may indicate a negative feedback regulation between trb3 and some downstream cytokines of erk1/2 mapk or special \ntrb3 expression is upregulated in renal tissue of dn mice in vivo and mmcs in vitro .\ntrb3 may be involved in dn by regulating the fibrosis cytokine tgf-1 and collagen type iv via erk1/2 mapk signaling ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " to reveal the expression and possible role of tribbles homolog 3 ( trb3 ) in the incidence of type 2 diabetic nephropathy , we used immunohistochemistry , real - time quantitative pcr , western blot analysis , and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) to study the expression of trb3 , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( erk1/2 mapk ) , transforming growth factor 1 ( tgf-1 ) , and collagen type iv in kidneys of db / db diabetic mice and in murine renal mesangial cells stimulated with high glucose . \n the expression of trb3 , tgf-1 , and collagen type iv was increased in kidneys of db / db diabetic mice . \n tgf-1 and collagen type iv regulated by high glucose through erk1/2 mapk were downregulated by silencing trb3 in renal mesangial cells . \n trb3 may be involved in diabetic nephropathy by regulating the fibrosis cytokine tgf-1 and collagen type iv through the erk1/2 mapk signaling pathway .

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are medical helper that speaks professionally and give well-supported facts."}, {"role": "user", "content": "recently , it was reported that the deterioration in pulmonary function associated with the development of chronic obstructive lung disease ( copd ) is directly related to both the duration of the smoking habit and the number of pack \nyears consumed.1,2 a better understanding of how the smoking habit influences the deterioration in respiratory mechanics would be useful in the precocious diagnosis of copd , which is usually obtained only in the later stages when respiratory function is already impaired . owing to the high prevalence of and medical costs associated with copd ,\nthe precocious identification and treatment of these patients is important in order to avoid the severe and expensive stages of this disease.3   the alterations in respiratory mechanics due to smoking are usually evaluated using respiratory flows and volumes obtained by spirometry .\nhowever , the modifications in respiratory mechanics are not always detected by this test.4 moreover , some patients are not able to perform spirometry reliably , as it requires good subject cooperation and maximal effort.5 the forced oscillation technique ( fot ) offers a simple and detailed approach to investigate the mechanical properties of the respiratory system .\nthis method characterizes the respiratory impedance and its two components , respiratory system resistance ( rrs ) and reactance ( xrs ) .\nthese parameters are usually measured at various frequencies by means of small pressure oscillations ( about 2  cmh2o ) superimposed at the mouth during spontaneous breathing .\nthe method is simple , requires only passive cooperation , and no forced expiratory maneuvers .\nanother important advantage , particularly in pathophysiological research , is that the fot is able to provide information on the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system that are complementary to spirometry.68 the fot was applied successfully by a number of investigators to obtain a detailed analysis of the respiratory mechanics in smokers compared with nonsmokers,4,911 as well as comparisons among nonsmokers , former smokers , and smokers.12 recently , this technique has also been applied successfully in our laboratory in physiological studies of the aging process,13 in the detection of early respiratory changes in smokers,14 as well as in studies conducted in asthmatic15 and sarcoidotic16 patients .\ntherefore , the fot has great potential to increase our knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of smoking , as well as in helping in the clinical diagnosis of respiratory alterations in this disease .\nhowever , to the best of our knowledge , there are no available data using the fot to investigate changes in respiratory impedance in groups with different degrees of tobacco consumption . in this context , the purpose of this study was twofold : ( 1 ) to evaluate the ability of the fot indices to detect smokinginduced respiratory alterations , with special emphasis on early alterations ; and ( 2 ) to compare the diagnostic accuracy of fot and spirometric parameters in groups with different numbers of pack  years .\nthen , the sensitivity and specificity of the fot parameters in identifying respiratory alterations in groups with different numbers of pack  years were analyzed .\nfinally , the diagnostic accuracy of fot parameters was compared with the figures obtained by spirometric volumes and flows .\nas it is impossible to answer the questions proposed in this study based on a followup of individual subjects , a crosssectional study in comparable groups of healthy individuals and smoking patients with several degrees of tobacco consumption was performed , in a similar way to the work conducted by verbanck et al.17 therefore , healthy control subjects with normal spirometry who had never smoked , as well as smoking subjects who were on no regular medications and had no allergic , respiratory , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , renal , or neurological symptoms were recruited .\nall subjects had stable health for at least four consecutive weeks and had signed written informed consent .\nbaseline data , including age , height , and weight , were obtained from each subject at the time of the procedures .\nall smokers were current smokers and had been instructed to abstain from smoking for at least 2  h before the testing .\nthe amount of tobacco smoked and the duration of smoking were quantified using the number of pack \nyears , which was calculated by multiplying the mean number of packs ( 20 cigarettes ) consumed daily by the number of years that the subject had their smoking habit.18 the smoking subjects were then stratified into subgroups of < 20 , 2039 , 4059 , and > 60 pack  years .\nsmokers were recruited from both university personnel who smoke and patients who visited the smoking cessation clinic .\nin addition , another 26 patients with documented copd and a smoking history of > 23.5 pack  years were recruited from the outpatient clinic .\ntotal respiratory resistance and reactance were measured using a forced oscillation system as described previously.1921 these measurements were conducted in conformity with the recommendations issued by a task force from the european respiratory society.8 briefly , smallamplitude pressure variations from 4 to 32  hz generated by a loudspeaker were applied at the mouth , using a mouthpiece .\nthe pressure input was measured with a honeywell 176  pc pressure transducer ( honeywell microswitch , boston , ma , usa ) and airway flow with a screen pneumotachograph .\nthe signals were digitized by a personal computer , and their fast fourier transform ( fft ) was computed using blocks of 4,096  points .\nthree measurements were made of 16  s each , and the result of the test was calculated as the mean of these measurements . to perform the fot analysis ,\nthe volunteer remained in a sitting position , keeping the head in a normal position and breathing at functional residual capacity ( frc ) through a mouthpiece . during the measurements , the subjects wore a nose clip and firmly supported their cheeks and submandibular tissue with their hands.8,22,23   the validity of the data was measured by computing the coherence function .\nonly values with a coherence function of 0.9 or more were considered adequate.11,24,25 any time the computed coherence was less than this threshold , the maneuver was not considered valid , and the examination was repeated . whenever adequate coherence measurements could not be obtained according to these criteria , the patient was excluded from the study.16,14,22,23   resistive impedance data were subjected to linear regression analysis over the frequency range of 416  hz .\nthe resistive impedance at 0  hz ( r0 ) was extrapolated from this analysis .\nthis parameter is related to the total resistance of the respiratory system.24 the mean resistance ( rm ) , commonly related to the airway caliber,7 was also calculated for this frequency range .\nadditionally , the slope of the resistive component of the respiratory impedance ( s ) , which is associated with respiratory system homogeneity,12,26 was also obtained from this analysis .\nnegative values of this parameter reflect abnormal patterns of ventilation distribution , which are related to alterations in ventilation  perfusion relationships .\nthe mean reactance ( xm ) , a property usually related to respiratory system nonhomogeneity,27 was calculated based on the entire studied frequency range ( 432  hz ) .\nrespiratory mechanical properties were also characterized by the resonance frequency ( fr ) , which is defined as the frequency at which the xrs equals zero , and the respiratory system dynamic compliance ( crs , dyn ) .\ndynamic compliance reflects the lungs and bronchial wall compliances , the compliance of the chest wall / abdomen compartment , and thoracic gas compression .\nthe time lag between spirometric and fot measurements was always < 15  min . using a closed circuit spirometer\n( vitrace vt139 ; promdico , rio de janeiro , brazil ) , measurements of forced vital capacity ( fvc ) , forced expiratory volume for the first second ( fev1 ) , fev1/fvc , and the ratio of forced expiratory flow ( fef ) between 25% and 75% of fvc to fvc ( fef / fvc ) were obtained for subjects in a sitting position .\nthese parameters were presented as raw data and percentiles of the predicted values ( % ) . predicted values for spirometry were obtained from knudson et al.28 and pereira et al.29 forced expiratory maneuvers were repeated until three sequential measurements were obtained .\nthe indices studied were those obtained through the better curve , which was selected based on the higher value of fev1 plus fvc .\nquality control of spirometry is given by the american thoracic society ( ats ) criteria , with the software allowing the detection of nonacceptable maneuvers .\nthe sample size for this study was calculated using the software medcalc version 8.2 ( medicalc software , mariakerke , belgium ) .\nit was based on an anticipated comparison of means obtained in preliminary studies and an assumption of type i and type ii errors of 5% .\nthe minimal sample size required was 32 subjects per group . in the present study ,\ninitially , univariate and multiple regression analyses were adjusted for pack  years and age and then applied to identify the association of these variables with the fot parameters .\nthe volunteers were then stratified and , when the achieved data presented a statistically normal distribution , the data were reanalyzed using oneway analysis of variance ( anova ) , which was further corrected by the tukey significant difference test . a nonparametric test ( kruskal  wallis ( kw ) ) , associated with a mann  whitney u test , was applied when the data did not present in a normal distribution .\nthe results are presented as meanstandard deviation . a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant . the performance of the fot indices in the detection of smokinginduced respiratory alterations in the several pack \nyears groups was evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analysis.30 these evaluations were constructed using medcalc 8.2 .\ncomparisons of the auc among parameters obtained from fot and spirometry were conducted using medcalc 8.2 , according to the theory described by metz.31 the values of sensitivity , specificity , and area under the curve ( auc ) for spirometry and fot were obtained based on the optimal cutoff point , as determined from the roc curve analysis.30\nin general , the spirometric parameters were highest in normal subjects and decreased significantly as the pack \nunivariate analyses ( table 2 ) show that all the fot parameters presented highly significant correlations with pack  years ( p<0.001 ) .\nyears was highly significant for all the fot parameters ( p<0.001 , table 3 ) .\nin contrast , the contribution of age was only significant for fr , xm and crs , dyn , whereas for r0 , it was not significant , and s and rm were near the limit of significance .\nthe amount of tobacco smoked significantly increased r0 ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , rm ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , and s ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , as seen in figure 1 .\nmean values of r0 and rm increased significantly when groups of normal and smoking subjects of < 20 pack \nthe comparisons between adjacent groups were statistically significant only for r0 when comparing the two highest pack \ns was not statistically significant when comparing the control with the < 20 or 2039 pack \nyears groups , but was significantly increased in comparison with the two highest pack  years groups ( p<0.001 ) . as the amount of tobacco smoked increased , crs , dyn ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) and xm ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) were significantly reduced , whereas fr ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) was increased ( figure 2 ) .\nthe differences comparing the control group with the < 20 and 2039 pack  years groups were not significant for fr and xm ( figure 2a and b ) .\nin contrast , the same comparisons resulted in significant reductions in crs , dyn ( figure 2c ) .\nconsidering the comparisons between adjacent classes , significant modifications were observed between the two highest pack  years groups in all three of the reactive parameters studied .\nfigure 3 presents the roc curves for fot and spirometric parameters in all the studied groups .\nthe performance of the fot and spirometric indices in the detection of smokinginduced respiratory alterations is described in figure 4 .\ntable 4 shows detailed values of area under the roc curve ( auc ) , sensitivity , and specificity for the optimal cutoff point for the fot indices .\nthe results of the comparative analysis among the auc of fot and spirometric parameters are described in figure 5 . in general , r0 ( figure 5a ) , rm ( figure 5c ) , and crs , dyn ( figure 5e ) presented significantly higher auc in smoking subjects with < 20 pack \nyears , and auc similar to that presented by spirometric parameters as the amount of tobacco smoked increased .\nspirometric parameters presented significantly higher auc than s ( figure 5b ) , fr ( figure 5d ) , and xm ( figure 5f ) considering groups of smoking subjects with 2039 pack  years and 4059 pack  years .\nthis study documented a significantly deleterious effect of smoking on the impedance of the respiratory system .\nalthough many other published reports have used the fot to compare control groups with exsmokers and/or smoking subjects , to the best of our knowledge , this study is the first study to investigate respiratory impedance in groups with different degrees of tobacco consumption .\nthe present study supports these results and also shows that these modifications are proportional to the number of pack  years the subjects smoked . in agreement with earlier studies,18,32 we found that the spirometric parameters decreased as the pack \nyears , had significant differences in age ( table 1 ) , which is expected because the increase in pack  years demands time for exposure . in the present study , we found that univariate analysis ( table 2 ) showed a higher relationship between the fot parameters and pack  years ( mean r  =  0.28 ) than between the fot parameters and age ( mean r  =  0.13 ) .\nin fact , age was not significantly related to the resistive fot parameters ( table 3 ) , whereas in the reactive parameters , the contributions of age were similar to pack \nyears in fr and xm , and negligible in csr , dyn . comparing r in univariate ( table 2 ) and multivariate analysis ( table 3 )\nthe significant increase in r0 ( figure 1a , kwanova , p<0.0001 ) and the moderate ( r  =  0.34 ) , but significant ( p<0.001 ) , correlation with pack \nsmoking leads to a series of bronchial modifications that are consistent with these results , including edema , inflammation in the mucosa , and hypertrophy of the mucosal glands , resulting in hypersecretion of mucus .\nhypertrophy of smooth muscle and fibrosis of the bronchial wall are two additional factors that can contribute to elevations in both airway and tissue resistances . increased r0 values for smoking subjects have been reported before.4,1012 the increase in r0 with pack  years can be explained given that modifications resulting from smoking begin in the small , peripheral airways , where large increases in resistance do not significantly increase total resistance .\nsignificant differences were observed comparing the control and the < 20 and 2039 pack  years groups .\nthis suggests that r0 values could be useful in detecting initial airway obstructions that are associated with smoking .\nmean resistance ( rm ) is associated with the caliber of the central airways.7 therefore , obstruction of these airways could explain the increases in rm values ( figure 1b ) , which could be related to inflammatory alterations.2 more specifically , rm increased significantly with pack \nyears ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , showing a significant ( p<0.001 ) relationship , which would explain 24% of the variance in this index .\nin contrast , we found significant differences between the control group and the smoking groups , even with the fewest pack \nalthough lndsr and colleagues9 and hayes and colleagues10 reported a small , but not significant , difference comparing values of nonsmokers with smokers , significant differences were reported by brochard and colleagues11 in similar studies conducted among nonsmokers , exsmokers , and smokers .\nfigure 1c shows that the respiratory system of the smoking subjects became more inhomogeneous with increasing pack \nyears . the significant modification in s ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) had moderate ( r  =  0.36 ) and significant ( p<0.0001 ) correlation with pack  years , which links increased tobacco consumption with decreased respiratory system homogeneity .\nit was not statistically possible to separate the mean s values of the control group from those of the < 20 and 2039 pack \nyears groups . on the other hand , comparisons between the control group and the 4059 and > 60 pack \nyears groups displayed significant differences ( p<0.006 ) , often associated with the more pronounced mechanical modifications present in these groups .\nsignificant differences between adjacent groups can be found when comparing the groups with higher tobacco consumption .\nthe shunt impedance of the upper airway walls , which are mechanically in parallel with the respiratory system , introduces an error that is expected to be large in obstructed patients33 and results in artifactual frequency dependence on the rrs values .\ntherefore , besides respiratory system nonhomogeneity , the upper airway wall shunt probably affects the results described in figure 1c . in the studied groups ,\nyears of tobacco smoking were significantly associated with a decline in crs , dyn ( figure 2a , kwanova , p<0.0001 ; r  =  0.37 , p<0.0001 ) .\ninterestingly , a highly significant decrease could already be noted comparing the control and the < 20 pack  years groups .\nin contrast to these results , hayes and colleagues10 found no differences when comparing the crs , dyn in nonsmokers and asymptotic smokers with normal spirometry . a reduction in crs , dyn values reflects a change in pulmonary tissue , chest wall , modification of the distensibility of the airways,7 and/or an increase in airway resistance.34 therefore\n, the reduction in the crs , dyn value observed in the smokers could be associated with a progressive increase in peripheral airway resistance or a reduction in respiratory system compliance .\nthere are always highly significant statistical differences in the comparisons between nonsmoking and smoking groups , which suggests the usefulness of crs , dyn as a sensitive index of smoking effects . increasing tobacco use in the studied groups\nwas associated with an increase in fr ( figure 2b ; kwanova , p<0.0001 ; r  =  0.50 , p<0.0001 ) . the comparisons of fr values between control and smoking groups\nthis suggests that fr is not useful as an index for the initial effects of smoking .\nyears in the different groups studied resulted in decreased xm mean values ( figure 2c ; kwanova , p<0.0001 ) . the significant inverse correlation between xm and pack  years ( r  =  0.57 , p<0.0001 ) reflects the impact of smoking on the reduction in respiratory system homogeneity and dynamic compliance of the studied subjects . comparing the control and smoking groups , statistically significant modifications were only observed between the control and the 4059 pack \nthese results suggest that xm might be useful in detecting the respiratory effects of smoking , predominantly in the more advanced stages .\nit must be pointed out that the results presented here need to be interpreted with caution . as several of the subjects studied\nwere recruited from the university hospital smoking cessation and outpatient clinics , these results can probably be limited to describe this population .\nrecently , the national heart , lung and blood institute recommended that research on new technologies to improve noninvasive tests of lung function in copd should be a priority.35 the fot was suggested by crapo et al.5 as an attractive alternative for diagnosing obstruction in copd , as it requires little patient effort and cooperation .\ncosio and colleagues36 pointed out that the pathological changes induced by tobacco use were still potentially reversible up to 770 cigarettes / day  years smoked ( 38.5 pack \nour results comparing r0 , rm , and crs , dyn in the group with < 20 pack \nyears ( mean  =  7.35.4 pack  years ) and the group with 2039 pack  years ( mean  =  29.35.6 pack  years ) suggest that small abnormalities exist prior to 38.5 pack \nyears ( figures 1 and 2 ) and that fot could be useful in detecting the effects of smoking , while they are still potentially reversible . in order to investigate this possibility ,\nroc curves were elaborated . according to the literature , roc curves with aucs between 0.50 and 0.70\nindicate low diagnostic accuracy , aucs between 0.70 and 0.90 indicate moderate accuracy , and aucs between 0.90 and 1.00 indicate high accuracy.30,37 an auc > 0.80 is usually considered adequate for clinical use.30,37 thus , s , xm , and fr reached acceptable values for clinical use only in the group with the higher duration of the smoking habit ( figures 3 and 4 , table 4 ) .\nin contrast , auc values for r0 , rm , and crs , dyn near to those considered for high accuracy measurements were obtained for the 2039 pack \nyears group ( figures 3 and 4 , table 4 ) . in this condition ,\nrm was the most adequate to correctly identify the effects of smoking , with a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 85.3% . as expected , because of the smaller alterations in respiratory mechanics , the < 20 pack \nyears group showed reduced auc values ( figures 3 and 4 , table 4 ) . even in this adverse situation , r0 and rm were able to obtain auc values considered adequate for clinical use , while crs , dyn reached the limit value ( 0.78 ) . among all the studied parameters , r0 was the best , showing a sensitivity of 73.5% and a specificity of 73.5% .\nthese promising results suggest that the fot may be useful in prevention of the adverse effects of the smoking habit , noninvasively detecting early smokinginduced respiratory abnormalities while the pathologic changes are still potentially reversible .\nthis also suggests that the fot may be useful as a screening tool in the management of smokinginduced lung disease .\ndifference in auc has become one of the most commonly used measures for comparing the performance of two diagnostic systems.38 according to metz,31 when we have a number of roc curves to compare , the auc is usually the best discriminator . in smoking subjects with < 20 pack  years , this analysis was clearly in favor of r0 and rm ( figure 5a and c ) .\nthe diagnostic accuracy of crs , dyn was higher than all the spirometric parameters , except fef2575% ( figure 5e ) .\nthere were no statistically significant differences in auc considering xm , fr , and s and the spirometric parameters ( figure 5b , d and f ) .\nthis suggests that r0 , rm , and crs , dyn values could be more useful than spirometric parameters in detecting early changes associated with smoking .\nthe results obtained in the present study considering patients with 2039 pack  years show that the area under the roc curve was significantly larger for r0 , rm , and crs , dyn than for fev1(% ) and fev1(l ) ( figure 5a , c and e ) .\non the other hand , several spirometric parameters presented significantly higher auc values than s , fr , and xm ( figure 5b , d and f ) .\noostven et al.,8 suggested that , in general , the clinical diagnostic capacity of respiratory impedance measurement by the fot is comparable to that of spirometry . in line with this hypothesis ,\nthe comparison of diagnostic accuracy of the fot and spirometric parameters in the group of patients with 4059 pack  years revealed similar performances of r0 , rm , and crs , dyn and spirometric parameters ( figure 5a , c and e ) .\nthe majority of the parameters obtained by spirometric measurements were significantly more accurate than s , fr , and xm ( figure 5b , d and f ) , which suggests that r0 , rm , and crs , dyn are as useful as spirometry , and that spirometric parameters are more adequate than s , fr , and xm as indices of smoking effects in this range of pack  years .\nthe spirometric parameters fev1(% ) and fev1(l ) are standard measures of lung function commonly used in the evaluation of patients with copd.39 the diagnostic performance of r0 ( figure 5a ) and crs , dyn ( figure 5e ) was significantly higher than that of fev1(% ) and fev1(l ) , and similar to that presented by other spirometric parameters in smoking subjects with > 60 pack \nrm and s showed accuracies similar to those presented by the spirometric parameters ( figure 5b and c ) . in general , fr and xm were less accurate than spirometric parameters ( figure 5d and f ) .\nspirometric measurements require good cooperation , are also effort dependent , and can lead to temporary alterations in bronchomotor tone due to the deep inspiration required , which can have implications for respiratory mechanics measurements . in contrast , the fot is easy to perform , requires minimal cooperation from the patient , and no respiratory maneuvers are needed .\nthese practical considerations , together with the results of the present study , indicate that r0 , crs , dyn , rm , and s may be added to other conventional examinations to help with the clinical evaluation of patients with copd who are not able to adequately perform spirometric measurements . in conclusion ,\nthe smoking habit resulted in changes in respiratory mechanics that were proportional to pack  years .\nthe fot provided resistive and reactive parameters that were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology .\nan important increase in respiratory system resistance and a reduction in dynamic compliance were observed in all the groups studied .\naccordingly , the parameters with the highest sensitivity and specificity for identifying smoking patients were r0 , rm , and crs , dyn . even in the group with the smallest alterations ( < 20 pack \nyears ) , r0 and rm were able to obtain auc values considered adequate for clinical use .\nour data demonstrated that the fot might be useful for early detection of obstructive disease related to the smoking habit , which agrees with the literature consensus that the mechanical modifications resulting from smoking should be detected as early as possible in order to advise smoking cessation .\nthe comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of the fot and spirometric parameters indicated that r0 , rm , and crs , dyn were more accurate than spirometric indices in diagnosing smaller alterations ( < 20 pack \nthese parameters presented diagnostic performance similar to the spirometric parameters in groups with higher pack  years .\nthese results suggest that the fot can be proposed as a complementary method to detect the harmful effects of smoking while they are still potentially reversible , contributing to copd prevention , diagnosis , and treatment .\nthe brazilian council for scientific and technological development ( cnpq ) and the rio de janeiro state research supporting foundation (

posterior ( ap ) body axis , such as limbs , are induced by the same molecular mechanism . based on those two contentions\nhowever , we now know that mrs arise prior to completion of mammary line formation in the mouse , and not in sequence along the ap - axis , which suggests that the presumption that the mammary line is a pre - existing structure from which the mammary glands subsequently derive by a shared mechanism , is incorrect , at least for mice . moreover , defects in the formation and morphogenesis of select mammary gland pairs in various genetically modified mice show that different signaling networks induce and maintain mammary gland development at different positions along the ap - axis .\nfurthermore , the reciprocal tissue interactions governing mammary gland development   may co - vary with the high internal left - right ( lr ) asymmetry of the trunk .\nindeed , lr - asymmetry between counterparts of mammary gland pairs has also become evident .\nfuture studies on normal and pathological mammary gland development will benefit greatly from consistent documentation and analysis of data relative to mammary gland position .\naccordingly , we will refer to them by number 110 , as opposed to pair ( 15 ) or position ( fig\n.  1 ) , unless the cited literature refers to mammary glands as clusters ( e.g. anterior , posterior ) without explicit specification of which glands were subject to examination .\nthe 2:1 correlation between the number of mammary glands and average litter size in most species   and co -

red stained skin of an e18.5 wild - type ( c57bl6/j ) mouse embryo showing ap - axial differences in extent of outgrowth and branching of the mammary rudiments . note\nthat branching morphogenesis is not stereotypical , and left -

right counterparts of a pair have no mirror - imaged symmetric morphology .\nmg : mammary gland ; hf : hair follicle why do mesodermal genes act differently at different positions along the mammary line ?\nthe answer may be found in their expression pattern , which is in part reflected in the temporal development of the murine mammary line .\nthis line is actually composed of three initially unconnected streaks of wnt10b expression . as concluded from the phenotypes summarized in table  1 , these streaks form independently of each other . the first streak forms on the flank , between the limbs . its initially fragmented wnt10b expression pattern in wild - type embryos ( fig .  1 ) and\ndorsalized position upon hypaxial truncation of the somites , as in pax3 null mutants , indicate somitic involvement in the formation of this streak .\nfgf10 is expressed highly in the hypaxial dermomyotomal tips of somites # 1218 , which underlie the region where mr2/7 and mr3/8 form [ 14 , 15 ] .\npartial reduction of somitic fgf10 expression , as in gli3 null or hypomorphic fgf10 mutants , allows formation of a mammary line and all mrs except mr3/8 , indicating that at least this pair requires somitic fgf10 and , contrary to mr2/7 , is susceptible to reduced levels of fgf10 .\nfgf10 is not expressed in somites 1924 , and neither wnt10b expression in this region nor induction of mr4/9 ( above # 24 somites ) requires fgf10/fgfr2b signaling .\nthese observations suggest that the anterior and posterior regions of this streak are two separate entities which develop by independent mechanisms , and that another yet to be identified somitic molecule(s ) may be responsible for the initiation of mammogenesis in the posterior region , at the posterior edge of which arises mr4 or mr9 .\ninterestingly , the boundary between the fgf10-dependent and fgf10-independent region at the level of # 18 somites is home to a small mesenchymal nrg3 expression domain , which seems a prerequisite for normal formation of mr3/8 .\nthe two other mammary streaks are located in the axilla and inguen , where they give rise to mr1/6 and mr5/10 , respectively .\ndefects in these streaks or their mrs often coincide with defects in limb induction or specification in the absence of limb mesenchymal factors like tbx2 , tbx3 , gli3 and fgf10 [ 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 ] .\nit remains to be determined whether mr1/6 and mr5/10 require such factors or the limb mesenchyme directly , or indirectly via formation of the limbs as new signaling centers .\nperhaps mr2/7 , that form at the junction of the first and axillary streak , and depend less than mr3/8 on somitic signals , similarly benefit from signals that originate in the limb . in conclusion ,\nmrs develop due to in part variable mesodermal inductive signals along the ap - axis that converge on common ectodermal executive pathways .\nthus , the different glands experience unique developmental histories and , furthermore , are embedded and surrounded by tissue that exhibits region - specific properties .\nthe embryonic flanks develop in the trunk as two broad lateral regions where the dorsal paraxial mesoderm intermingles with the ventral lateral plate mesoderm ( lpm ) .\nthey establish new , ventro - lateral boundaries with the ventrum , which serve as bilateral platforms for mammary line formation .\nexternally , these presumptive mammary forming regions look left - right ( lr ) symmetric . but looks can be deceiving !\nlr asymmetries during mammogenesis become evident at the level of individual mammary gland pairs : the size and branching pattern differ between contralateral glands ; one counterpart of a normal or supernumerary pair may be missing or shifted from its symmetric position , shown for mouse in figs .  2 and 3 .\nin humans with poland syndrome , one breast ( most often the right ) may remain hypoplastic .\ninterestingly , formation of the mammary line and mrs is slightly advanced on the left side ( fig .  3 ) and the left side seems to have a greater mammogenic potential . for example ,\nunilateral polythelia or polymastia occurs most frequently on the left side in humans   and mice .fig .\nimages of flanks of lac - z stained mice ( mixed genetic backgrounds ) expressing topgal as a marker for mammary line and rudiment formation .\ntop four panels show left - right asynchrony in formation of the mammary line and mammary rudiment ( mr ) pair 2 and 7 .\nlower four panels show anterior shift of mr 8 and formation of supernumerary mrs ( indicated as 3 and 4 near the normal mr3 and mr4 ) examples of left - right asymmetry in embryonic mammary gland development\n. images of flanks of lac - z stained mice ( mixed genetic backgrounds ) expressing topgal as a marker for mammary line and rudiment formation .\ntop four panels show left - right asynchrony in formation of the mammary line and mammary rudiment ( mr ) pair 2 and 7 .\nlower four panels show anterior shift of mr 8 and formation of supernumerary mrs ( indicated as 3 and 4 near the normal mr3 and mr4 ) the basis for lr asymmetric mammary gland development is likely rooted in embryonic lr patterning : during vertebrate embryogenesis , the lr axis establishes the positions of the heart and visceral organs and promotes structural asymmetries that are necessary for their functions .\nthe driving force for lr patterning is unilateral activity of molecules such as the secreted factor nodal , which is expressed by the left half of the node , left - sided lpm and overlying ectoderm . in the left - sided lpm\n, nodal initiates the expression of the transcription factor pitx2 , an essential  interpreter  of lr axial patterning during organogenesis [ reviewed by 23 ] .\nthus , as ectodermal appendages that are induced at the ventro - lateral boundaries , i.e. at the fronts of somitic penetration into two molecularly different regions of left and right lpm , the left and right mammary glands have distinct molecular  histories  from their inception ! moreover , and despite their morphological bilateral symmetry , the left and right somites also differ from each other with significant lr differences in gene expression [ 24 , 25 ] . of interest\nis perhaps heparin - binding egf - like growth factor , which is transiently elevated on the left side , temporally overlapping with formation of mr3/8 .\nfurthermore , retinoic acid ( ra ) signaling promotes lr asymmetry in the somites , as demonstrated by one - sided delay in somite formation in chick and zebrafish embryos , caused by pharmacological inhibition of ra production [ 26 , 27 ] .\nseveral modulators of ra signaling and synthesis , including raldh2 , are expressed in the somites proper , and the ra receptor rar is expressed in the flank mesenchyme underlying mr2/7 , 3/8 , 4/9 .\nunfortunately , laterality in effects of ra signaling on mammary gland development was not tested .\nthis will be difficult to do , due to lethality of ra - deprived mouse models prior to mammary gland formation , and due to artifacts introduced during mr development ex vivo under otherwise normal conditions , but especially under experimental conditions such as pharmological modulation of ra - signaling .\nhowever , it is of interest that ra - deficient raldh2 mouse embryos exhibit transiently delayed right - sided development and segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm into somites # 815 . with mr2/7 and mr3/8 forming above the # 12 and # 15 somites respectively ,\nit is thus conceivable that ra signaling may be a pivotal link between somitic laterality and asynchrony and asymmetry in development of lr counterparts of particularly these mr pairs .\nmoreover , the already known requirement of somitic signals for induction of mr3/8 , provides strong support for the hypothesis that this mammary gland pair  despite its seemingly morphological symmetry - may be lateralized , either directly or indirectly via inductive interaction with lateralized aspects of somites , including effects of ra - signaling .\nfinally , the curvature of the ap - body axis may also be involved in promoting subtle asymmetry of mammogenesis : most often the ap - axis is curved to the right ( tail over right shoulder ) , leading to a \nif molecular gradients are involved in early mammary gland formation , which is the case at least for somitic fgf10 , their shape may be different between left and right flanks , which could possibly explain the slight lr asynchrony in length of the mammary lines and mis - alignment between paired glands that is sometimes observed even in wild - type embryos ( fig . \na striking but still unexplained feature of breast cancer is a higher tumor incidence in the left breast .\nalthough modest with a ~1.10 left / right incidence ratio , such laterality was consistently found in several epidemiological studies [ 3036 ] regardless of gender and stage of disease . even in bilateral breast cancer cases ,\nsurvival rates also appear to reflect lr differences : a breast cancer study among 590 russian patients reported a statistically significant higher survival rate of patients with right - sided , advanced stage disease .\nin contrast , a study of 163 norwegian patients associated longer survival with left - sided disease , but did not relate this finding to disease stage . in a third study of 10,702 israeli women , no laterality was detected for overall patient survival from years 115 , but trends of a higher 510  year survival rate of left - sided later stage disease , and a higher 1015  year survival rate of right - sided early stage disease , call for statistical analysis of the data within such smaller time periods , which had not been done .\nthe most recent study of 384 pakistani breast cancer patients indicates that although left - sided tumors are larger and more prevalent , when standardized for tumor size , right - sided tumors are more prone to metastasis and are associated with lower survival rates .\nalthough the results of these studies appear discordant with each other , they certainly attest to the need for well - defined parameters to better assess laterality .\nfurthermore , these available data contest , at least in part , the assumption that asymmetry in survival may be due to radiation - induced heart damage , which is greater with left - side targeted therapy . instead , the data suggest that the lr differences may be due to lateralized tumor biology , similar to lr asymmetry in incidence and patient survival observed with cancers of other paired organs , including kidney cancer , which does not entail cardiac complications following side - specific radiation therapy [ 33 , 41 ]\n. why do tumors form with unequal probability and perhaps outcome in left versus right members of organ pairs ?\na variety of epidemiological correlates have been investigated , including age , race , ethnicity , sex , breast size , stage of disease at diagnosis , histological tumor type , and even left- versus right - handedness .\nnone of these factors emerged as a consistently significant variable for the increased left - sided incidence [ 3032 , 37 ] .\nby contrast , laterality in outcome may in part be explained by laterality of axillary lymph node metastasis .\na higher mean number of lymph nodes with metastases in breast cancer patients has been reported for right - sided tumors , consistent with more lymph nodes present on the right side [ 43 , 44 ] . however , when axillary lymph node involvement was analyzed with respect to the total number of affected nodes , the right - sided increase was present only in patients with 13 positive nodes . for patients with >\n3 positive nodes ( a characteristic of locally advanced or higher stage disease ) left - sided tumors were associated with more affected nodes despite the lr asymmetry in overall node number .\nthus , metastasis to lymph nodes seems to be a lateralized disease feature , and may indicate lr differences in tumor biology , e.g. greater metastatic potential of left - sided tumors , or lateralized features of the lymph nodes themselves .\nin general , attempts to identify lateralized features may be confounded by the profound heterogeneity of breast cancer and could possibly be improved by inclusion of more detailed cancer subtype - specific information such as genomic classifiers . indeed , an interesting correlate in laterality of breast tumors is the expression of her-2 and perhaps also hormone receptors , although the sidedness may co - vary with other parameters : among 166 kuwaiti patients spanning all disease stages at diagnosis , right - sided tumors are significantly associated with amplified her-2 expression , without lateralized differences for hormone receptor expression , whereas among 384 pakistani breast cancer patients with bone metastasis , right - sided tumors were markedly less prone to express her-2 , estrogen receptor , or progesterone receptor , either individually or in combination .\nit is tempting to speculate that the lr differences in tumor incidence and patient survival may be related to expression of genes that govern lr axial patterning during embryonic development , like nodal and pitx2 [ reviewed by 47 ] . increased expression of nodal and methylation of pitx2 dna correlates with poor prognostic outcome in breast cancer patients [ 4850 ] .\noverexpression of another nodal pathway component , the co - receptor cripto-1 , is also associated with decreased patient survival [ reviewed by 49 ] .\nconsistent with these findings , nodal pathway signaling promotes an invasive phenotype in breast cancer cells and induces tumor vascularization , which has implications for disease progression and relapse .\nwhether nodal or nodal pathway members are expressed asymmetrically during mammary gland development remains to be investigated , as does the question of whether such putative lr differences are recapitulated in breast tumors .\nwhile the laterality in breast cancer incidence and outcome seems subtle , evidence for its existence is compelling\n. we may be unaware of more significant aspects of laterality because situs is often not a factor in molecular and clinical correlations , and experimental data in mouse models typically are generated from a single side , or if from both sides , may be combined for analyses , obscuring potential lr differences .\nto our knowledge , laterality has not been investigated systematically in any mouse tumor mammary model to date .\nbetter insights into laterality of breast cancer incidence , biology , and outcome may lead to a better understanding of the disease(s ) and have prognostic value .\nthe axial position of the human breast approximates the 5th thoracic somite or its derived rib . taking into account the differences in somite number between mouse and human\n, this area corresponds best to the area between mg2/7 and 3/8 in the mouse .\nas described above , the five pairs of mammary glands in the mouse are each induced by unique inductive signaling networks . yet surprisingly little information exists on differences between the five pairs of glands in adult mice , both at the level of normal physiology and with respect to response to tumor - initiating events\n. however , several studies report significantly differential tumor incidence or biology depending on the position along the ap axis .\nso the answer is almost certainly : yes ! examples for ap variations in tumor - incidence and biology come from endogenous tumor agents , chemical carcinogenesis , various treatments , and transgenic approaches .\nintegration of mouse mammary tumor viruses ( mmtv ) in the c3h mouse strain causes mammary tumors most often in thoracic glands . while tumor incidences are equal among the gland pairs after correction for total wet tissue weight , the relative ratios of epithelial to stromal / adipose tissue may not correspond to wet weights and could confound the analysis\nindeed , increased incidence of dmba - induced tumors in the thoracic mammary glands of rats was correlated to asynchronous development of the glands .\ndifferences in the number of terminal end buds ( tebs ) and alveolar buds per gland results in variable abundance of target cells for chemical carcinogens depending on treatment age .\nlikewise , murine mg2/7 and mg3/8 exhibit a greater number and larger tebs than mg4/9 ( see also fig . \n2 ) ; and mg2/7 specifically undergoes a reduction in tebs from 5 to 6  weeks of age .\nthese ap - specific developmental features are a plausible basis for increased tumor incidence in thoracic glands .\ninterestingly , exposure to power frequency magnetic fields ( mf ) increases dmba - induced mammary tumorigenesis in sd1 rats , particularly of mg1/6 and 2/7 in correlation with more significant mf - induced increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity  a possible indicator for stem cell proliferation .\nhowever , in f433 fisher rats , mf exposure increased the incidence of dmba - induced adenocarcinoma specifically in the 5th of the six pairs of glands in rats , but latency was reduced most in the 3rd pair .\nthus , region - specific effects on tumorigenesis may vary even between strains of the same species .\ntransgenic mmtv - polyoma middle t antigen ( pymt ) causes the largest tumor burden with shortest latency in mg1/6 of c57bl/6 mice .\ntumor latency is more similar among all other glands , with mg4/9 harboring the second largest tumor burden .\nintroduction of an inos ( nos2 ) null mutation increases tumor latency and reduces tumor burden most in mg4/9 and least in mg1/6 .\noverexpressed erbb2 in mmtv - cneu mice   induces tumors preferentially in mg2/7  +  3/8 ( table  2 ) and tumor incidence is comparatively low in mg4/9/5/10 .\ntransgenic c3(1)-sv40-t / t - antigen causes tumor formation first in mg1/6 and mg2/7 with the highest total tumor burden in mg2/7 .\ndifferential activity of transgene promoters is one possible explanation for variations in transgene - initiated mammary tumorigenesis .\neven then , such mechanism(s ) would serve to highlight the significance of biological differences between pairs of glands .\nwhat is clear from these data , though , is that these transgenic models generate most tumors in specific anterior mammary glands , raising the question if other transgenic models exhibit similar or other unique gland - specific incidences along the ap-axis.table 2regional distribution of mammary tumors in mmtv - cneu transgenic micecohort \\ glandsmg1/6mg2/7 + 3/8mg4/9 + 5/10a4 ( 15)19 ( 73)**3 ( 12)b11 ( 27)26 ( 63)**4 ( 10)weight ( % ) ( 18)(46)(36)(a ) number of palpable tumors observed in 21 tumor -

effects poisson regression analysis transplantation experiments also provide clues to the existence of ap - axial effects both in the tumor cells and environment .\npymt tumor cells isolated from anterior tumors proliferate faster than cells from posterior tumors , independent of implantation site .\nsignificant differences in gene expression exist between anterior and posterior tumors despite equivalent histology , and the difference in proliferative potential was maintained over transplantation passages .\nmoreover , the higher take rate of teratocarcinoma cell grafts at lumbar subcutaneous sites despite their faster growth rate at thoracic sites   provides evidence for unique positional features .\nlikewise , mda - mb-435 tumor cell xenografts in thoracic mfps grow better in response to high fat diet but not when in inguinal mfps . thus , along the ap - axis , both the mammary epithelium and stroma harbor positional variations that influence tumor growth .\nfinally , modality of disease progression may also depend on positional differences : tumors of c3hxvy - avy mice are more likely to metastasize from thoracic glands than from abdominal glands .\nmda - mb-435 cell implants into mfps of athymic nude mice showed the same tendency and moreover , thoracic implants spread via the vascular system , while inguinal implants spread via the lymphatic system .\na comprehensive review article on wound healing , immune responsiveness , and mammary tumorigenesis in mice and rats , concluded that not only tumor growth , but also wound healing responses are more pronounced in anterior regions\n. the prominent role of inflammatory signaling in breast cancer suggests that this ap - gradient may influence murine mammary tumor biology .\nthe ap - gradient of the nervous system and vascularization , resulting in reduced blood flow in the posterior body , provides perhaps the likeliest explanation for the region - specific variations in tumor biology .\nsuch a gradient has also been confirmed for blood flow in pectoral versus inguinal mammary glands .\nconsequently , one can hypothesize that posterior glands exhibit reduced oxygen tension and lower concentrations of systemic factors , which may modulate tumor incidence .\nalternatively , varying relative positions of lymph nodes may alter lymph drainage of the tissue and consequently tumor biology .\nthe role of embryonic signaling pathways in promoting cancer cell stemness and metastasis   may suggest that differential intrinsic features of tumor cells and their microenvironment could possibly be traced back to the differential developmental signals along the mammary line of the mouse .\nfor example , by interpretation of regional cues , hox transcription factors lay down positional memory that results in region - of - origin specific cell biology , as shown for dermal fibroblasts . by analogy\n, mammary stroma may secrete unique factors depending on their position along the ap axis .\naberrant hox gene activity has also been implicated in breast cancer   and in altered wnt signaling [ 69 , 70 ] .\ngiven the prominent role of the wnt pathway in embryonic mg development and in breast tumor biology , it is conceivable that the hox and wnt pathways affect tumors differentially along the ap axis .\nthe mouse is an invaluable model system to study mammalian development , physiology and cancer . here , we reviewed evidence that each of the ten mammary glands in mouse is unique , from inception to maintenance , throughout normal and tumor development as well as metastasis .\nmechanistic insights into causes for variations in prenatal development of the mammary glands begin to emerge .\none can presently only speculate about the cause(s ) for regional variations in tumor incidence and biology , which may in part stem from intrinsic molecular differences during embryogenesis , and from variations in stromal factors including vascularization and lymph drainage .\nhowever , this phenomenon can possibly be exploited to gain insights into factors that modulate tumorigenesis .\nclearly , future studies on normal and pathological mammary gland development will benefit greatly from improved documentation of positional variations .\nin particular , laterality should be treated as a possible variable in studies of human patients to discern why tumor incidence and progression are lateralized disease features and to assess the potential implications for the clinic .\ninbred mouse strains and engineered mouse models provide unique opportunities to study positional variations from both left - right and anterior - posterior axis effects .\ninvaluable information may be lost when samples / data from different locations are combined before analyses , or confounded when phenotypic aspects of one gland are correlated to molecular data from another . moreover\n, experimental design and analysis of specific cancer models may improve when regional effects are taken into account , e.g. by tailoring treatments to developmental asynchrony and by making guided choices such as using inguinal glands for studies of lymphatic metastasis .\nultimately , such consideration of positional variations in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis should improve the predictive value of studies in mouse for various aspects of human breast cancer ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " most mammals develop their mammary glands in pairs of which the two counterparts are symmetrically displaced away from the ventral midline . based on this symmetry and the same functional outcome as a milk - producing organ , the mammary glands are easily presumed to be mere copies of one another . based on our analysis \n of published data with inclusion of new results related to mammary development and pathology in mice , we argue that this presumption is incorrect : between and within pairs , mammary glands differ from one another , and tumor incidence and biology depend on the position along the anterior - posterior and the left - right axis as well . \n this insight has implications for experimental designs with mouse models and for data extrapolation between mammary glands within and between species . \n we suggest that improved documentation of location - specific mammary gland features will lead to more insights into the molecular mechanisms of mammary gland development and cancer biology in both mice and humans .

based study conducted in pakistan using the international classification of diseases coding system ( icd ) showed that diseases of the respiratory tract were the most commonly encountered in all age groups followed by other infections , parasitic infestations , diseases of the skin and those affecting the nervous system.6 the above study showed that females were the clients of the primary care services in a ratio of 2:1 males , which is also consistent with what was obtained in our study with regard to the pattern of primary health care utilization at king faisal university 's medical center . in this age group ,\nthe women presenting for the first antenatal care visit constituted 85% of the total married women , which was far more than other studies at the level of primary health care including the whole spectrum of the population .\nit was also found that about 20% women of this reproductive age group utilized phc services for antenatal care.7 this difference could be explained by the fact that our study included women within the peak period of their fertility .\nresults obtained from the current study in this particular age group also agrees with those obtained from other cross - sectional studies to determine the pattern of morbidity among adolescents in riyadh city , in which out of the sample of 1473 , upper respiratory infections constituted 43% of the complaints.8 in another study to determine the workload of the primary health care services in the summer , it was revealed that respiratory problems represented 60% followed by 20% in digestive problems in those who used the curative services , most of whom were young , adolescent saudis.5 a case - control study conducted in finland to portray the socio - demographic characteristics and the psychosocial profile of the frequent attendees at the primary health care revealed that females more significantly utilized the available services .\nthis is consistent with our findings . in this study , using the icd-9 , the most commonly encountered problems in the over 15 years age group were musculoskeletal disorders , respiratory , and digestive problems .\nthe reason for this is that frequent users had more mental problems than controls.9 in 4% of the cases , no specific diagnosis was recorded , which is far less than the results obtained in a similar study which claimed that the records of 46 % of all visits to primary health care did not include any kind of diagnosis . in addition , this study revealed that non - communicable diseases namely hypertension , diabetes , bronchial asthma , eye , ear , cardiologic and dermatologic problems were the main problems encountered among the adult subjects.10 the previous conclusions conflict with those obtained in our study as the included subjects were younger .\nseveral studies revealed that dental problems were peculiar to the pediatric age group,681012 while in this study it represented 9% of all morbidity of the age group 18 to 35 years .\nthis may reveal the reason for the persistence of these problems in the transition to adulthood and the reasons for encountering them in the primary health care services .\nthe problems of chronic morbidity among the age group in our study was bronchial asthma ( 6% ) as the most commonly diagnosed disorder .\nthis finding is in accord with that revealed by another survey conducted among 1473 saudi adolescents attending primary health care . in that study ,\nabout 10% of those between the ages 15 - 24 years had a chronic morbidity condition , the most frequently diagnosed being bronchial asthma.7 this study revealed a nearly constant trend of the rate of referral to the higher level of care ( 6% of cases ) as was found in a study to ascertain the morbidity pattern and evaluate the referral system in primary health centers in jeddah , kingdom of saudi arabia . in that study , 5% of the patients were referred to secondary and tertiary health care levels .\nthe feedback was only in 22.7% , and the majority of referral letters lacked the necessary information on the patient.13 in our study , there was no documentation of the feedback and the validity of the referral letters was questionable .\nour results on the seasonal variation of the morbidity problems included , particularly on respiratory , gastrointestinal and skin problems , match those obtained from other studies , where the peak incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal problems was in late winter and mid - summer . for skin lesions ,\nthe highest peak was early in the summer.714 this study raised the important issue of recording morbidity encountered in phc settings .\nproper morbidity recording is vital in phc practices since they reflects the changing needs of the served population and would therefore aid the preparation of the centre and health team to deal with the dynamically changeable health problems.15 finally , the included medical records demonstrated a great deal of inconsistency , lack of agreement , identification , and retrieval difficulties .\none of the basic practices of community - oriented primary care ( copc ) is to record morbidity in a standardized easily retrievable fashion that allowed the user to monitor the health of the community by means of simple analytic procedures .\na proper recording system may aid the processes of the prediction of disease , evaluation of the health needs , and the determination of the logistic , technical and training requirements of the health team at the primary care level.16\n\n standardization of problem - oriented medical records would be helpful in providing information about different patterns of morbidity encountered at the level of primary health care.the patterns emerging may provide a strong foundation for health promotive activities especially in the field of health education , particularly on how to avoid exposure to risk factors of conditions such as dental problems , allergic disorders , and respiratory and other infections .\nthey would also assist in the tracking of chronic diseases , the promotion of lifestyle modification and the proper utilization of the available health services.a standardized referral system is required to improve the link between health providers and the selection of the best evidence -

sized liver tissue was obtained .\nthe patient then complained that she felt a twinge - like pain in her right chest that radiated into the right shoulder .\nanalgesics were administered , after which the pain and dyspnea gradually subsided . at that time , the patient 's vitals were stable and further sequelae were not expected . on the same day , at 11:30\nwe suspected the patient was suffering from hemorrhagic shock due to bleeding from an iatrogenic liver injury .\nabdominal ct showed that the right lobe of the liver was severely compressed by a huge subcapsular hematoma ( fig .\n1 ) . packed red blood cells ( rbcs ) and crystalloid were administered and inotrophics were infused . at the same time , an emergency angiography was performed which revealed that the bleeding came from the right hepatic artery .\nthe patient 's blood pressure remained relatively stable after the procedure , but began to fall when we tried to taper off the dose of inotrophics .\na second angiogram obtained on the tenth day in hospital showed no evidence of arterial bleeding .\nthe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ( icu ) . despite being transfused with 10 , 3 , 3 , and 2 units of packed rbc on days 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 , respectively , the patient 's hemoglobin levels gradually decreased from 13.1 to 8.8 g / dl . in total ,\n18 units ( 4,500 ml ) of packed rbc were transfused prior to the infusion of rfviia . on the eleventh day in hospital , the patient was given 500,000 units of aprotinin ( rotinin inj ; han lim pharm , seoul , korea ) over 15 min as the loading dose , after which 200,000 units were infused continuously each hour for 5 h as the maintenance dose . despite the injection of aprotinin ,\nthe patient 's hemoglobin levels decreased persistently . on the twelfth day in hospital , the patient was given 2.4 mg ( 40 g / kg ) of rfviia 4 times every 2 hours , and then 4.8 mg ( 80 g / kg ) 3 times every 2 hours . on day 13 ,\nthe blood pressure and hemoglobin levels of the patient stabilized in the absence of transfusion ( fig .\n, the patient 's laboratory results revealed that her prothrombin time was 20.7 s ( inr 2.03 ) , her activated partial thromboplastin time was 82.0 s , her fibrin degradation product level was 17.5 g / ml , and her d - dimer level was 6,245 ng / ml . the patient was treated in the icu for 2 months because of the intra - abdominal and the intrathoracic hematoma and its complications , namely dic due to massive transfusion , acute renal failure , acute respiratory failure , and liver failure due to liver necrosis .\nthe patient recovered gradually from these complications in terms of liver injury and jaundice ( fig .\na follow - up ct scan showed a considerable reduction in the size of the subcapsular hematoma .\nthe results of the liver biopsy were compatible with toxic hepatitis , but we remained unable to exclude autoimmune hepatitis completely .\nwe describe here a patient with subcapsular hematoma that developed after percutaneous liver biopsy . to obtain hemostasis , we attempted embolization of the right hepatic artery and intravenous injections with aprotinin .\nthese methods failed to stem the gradual decrease in hemoglobin levels that persisted despite the transfusion of large amounts of packed rbcs .\nfinally , four 40 g / kg doses and three 80 g / kg doses of rfviia were administered intravenously .\nclinically significant intraperitoneal hemorrhage is the most serious bleeding complication of percutaneous liver biopsy . the mortality rate among patients after percutaneous liver biopsy is approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 12,000 [ 1 , 6 ] .\ntwo cases of subcapsular hematoma have been reported , one in a patient receiving a liver graft and the other in a patient with cholestatic liver disease .\nthe present case had severe cholestasis associated with toxic hepatitis , but no underlying chronic liver disease [ 3 , 7 ] .\nif hemorrhage is suspected , the administration of iv fluids and blood products should be performed immediately to improve the patient 's hemodynamic status , and a surgeon and an angiographer should be kept on standby . if hemodynamic instability persists for a few hours despite the use of aggressive resuscitative measures , angiography and embolization or surgical exploration are indicated .\nit is generally believed that timely percutaneous external drainage of the large hematoma is needed to prevent the compression of functioning hepatocytes , which may harm the liver , although some authors insist that it may remove the tamponade effect of the hematoma on the bleeding focus .\nwhile rfviia was developed to manage bleeding in hemophiliac patients who express inhibitors of clotting factors , it was unclear why rfviia but not endogenous fvii could overcome coagulopathy in hemophiliac patients\n. a cell - based conceptual model of hemostasis that focuses on the roles of specific cell surfaces in controlling the coagulation process may shed light on this phenomenon .\nfviia can bind to activated platelets and , once bound to the activated platelet surface , can activate factor x. the cell - based model suggests that while the low levels of endogenous fviia can not induce thrombin generation on the platelet surface , when rfviia is added to the system , thereby elevating the total fviia levels , the thrombin - generating function of the platelet surface can be restored . in the present case ,\nrfviia was administered after we identified and embolized the bleeding focus in the course of right hepatic artery because the bleeding did not stop , even though there was no obvious bleeding point after embolization , as indicated by the second angiography .\nthus , we can presume that the administration of rfviia successfully controlled the undisclosed bleeding from the site where the biopsy was performed . which dose of rfviia is appropriate for a bleeding patient who does not have deficiency of coagulation factor vii ?\none study showed that when patients with chronic liver disease are given 80 g / kg rviia prior to surgical incision during orthotopic liver transplantation , it is both safe and effective .\nanother study showed that the decline in hematocrit during an operation undergoing liver resection was smallest in the group receiving 80 g / kg of rfviia , and that this was associated with a significant overall improved effect of treatment . in our patient , we administered a half dose of rfviia 3 times on the twelfth day . on the thirteenth day in hospital\n, we administered the full dose of rfviia 3 times because the half dose was suboptimal for hemostasis , totaling 400 g / kg .\nrfviia is effective for hemostasis not only in hemophiliac patients , but also in patients with thrombocytopathies , liver transplantation [ 9 , 13 ] , and hemophiliac patients undergoing orthopedic surgery .\nwe would like to report the successful use of rfviia in a dic patient with potentially fatal iatrogenic bleeding .\nwe also suggest that dic should be omitted from the contraindication list of rfviia use ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " recombinant activated coagulation factor vii ( rfviia ) is known to be effective in the management of acquired deficiencies of factor vii and platelet function defects . but \n recently , rfviia has been successfully used to treat ongoing bleeding in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ( dic ) condition . \n the patient reported here was suspected to be suffering from toxic hepatitis on admission . \n after percutaneous liver biopsy , bleeding occurred and did not stop even after right hepatic artery embolization . \n the patient developed a severe hemorrhage that resulted in hypovolemic shock , hemoperitoneum , and a massive subcapsular hematoma . \n the patient then developed dic due to massive transfusion , as well as acute liver necrosis . \n the patient was given 400 g / kg of rfviia . \n recombinant factor viia was administered in an attempt to control the bleeding . \n this stabilized the hemoglobin levels of the patient . \n the patient gradually recovered in 4 months . in conclusion \n , this case suggests that rfviia can be successfully used for the hemostasis of uncontrolled bleeding in dic .

electronic and nano - technology revolution  [ 1 - 3 ] . the fundamental issue of such a revolution is the effort towards the fabrication of innovative nano - structured functional materials and , in particular , the acquisition of the capability to control all their characteristics ( electrical , optical , mechanical , etc . ) by the atomic - level manipulation of the structural ones .\nin particular , nano - structured materials fabricated by metal nanocrystals ( ncs ) dispersed in or deposited on insulator matrices have been extensively studied [ 4 - 7 ] because their unique optical , magnetic and electrical properties and thanks to the possibility of control such properties in a wide range simply controlling the ncs structural properties ( atomic structure , size , density , etc . ) .\nit is well - known that the ncs characteristics are size - dependent and intermediate between the properties of the atomic and bulk matter : such a peculiar property results from the ncs nanometric dimensions and in particular from the enhanced surface - area - to - volume ratio ( with respect to the bulk matter ) and thus vary as a function of nc size ( as a consequence of the limited number of atoms incorporated therein and the considerable influence of surface atoms ) . for these reasons ,\nnano - structured materials based on metal ncs acquired a relevant role for the design and fabrication of nano - devices with numerous applications ranging from micro- and nano - electronics to catalysis , gas sensor , biology and many others . on the other hand , in view of the fabrication of innovative nano - devices using metal ncs in / on insulator substrates with pre - determined tunable ( electrical , optical , ... ) properties , it is fundamental to know the details of the chemical and physical interaction between the ncs and the surrounding environment to understand ( and to control ) the structural ones and their evolution as a function of the ncs size . in the present work ,\nwe study the influence of the surrounding environment on the atomic structure and equilibrium shape of growing ncs focusing on au ncs / sio2 system .\nwe choose such a system because its potential application in the fabrication of nano - electronic , optoelectronic ( plasmonics ) and gas - sensor innovative devices [ 10 - 12 ] . on the other hand ,\nexists from 80s a vast experimental and theoretical literature concerning the study of free and supported au ncs [ 9,13 - 24 ] .\nthe experimental works are primarily based on the study of the au ncs structure and equilibrium shape by transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) , while the theoretical ones on simulation of the atomic structures and equilibrium shapes by several models ( monte - carlo , density functional theory ) .\nthe present work , gives a contribution to the experimental investigation evidencing clear differences ( by tem analyses ) in the atomic structure and equilibrium shape of growing au ncs embedded in sio2 layers from those supported on sio2 and can furnish new theoretical basis to include the effect of the environment surrounding the ncs in the simulation models .\nan explanation of the observed differences in terms of thermodynamic concepts and symmetry considerations is given .\nin particular , we demonstrate how to extract quantitative information about the surface free energy of the au ncs grown in and on sio2 using the inverse wulff construction basing on the equilibrium shape inferred by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy ( hr - tem ) .\nfurthermore , the method to growth ideal ncs on surfaces come out and the conclusions can be extended to other crystalline nanoclusters of other materials .\nto avoid any possible difference in the au ncs structures and shapes as a consequence of differences in samples preparation , we followed a unique procedure to prepare the samples with ncs inside and over amorphous sio2 .\ncz- < 100 > silicon substrates with resistivity   6      10  cm were etched in a 10% aqueous hf solution to remove the native oxide , and subsequently annealed at 1223 k for 15 min in o2 in order to grow an uniform , 10 nm thick , amorphous sio2layer ( as determined by ellypsometric measurements and subsequent cross - sectional tem ) .\na 2 nm thick au film was deposited ( at room temperature ) by sputtering on the sio2layer using an emitech k550x sputter coater apparatus ( ar plasma , 10 pa pressure ) . in some samples\nthe au layer was covered by a 3 nm thick sio2layer deposited ( at room temperature ) by sputtering using an aja rf magnetron sputtering apparatus ( ar plasma , 1.3      10 pa pressure ) .\nthen , the au / sio2and sio2/au / sio2samples were contemporary annealed in ar ambient in the 8731073 k temperature range and in the 560 min time range to obtain the ncs self - organization and growth .\nthe samples were analyzed by rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) , tem and hr - tem , after mechanical polishing and final ar ion milling .\nthe rbs analyses were performed using 2 mevhebackscattered ions at 165. the tem analyses were performed by a jeol 2010f energy filtered transmission microscope ( eftem ) , operating at 200 kv and equipped with a gatan image filtering apparatus .\neftem allowed to map of the elemental composition of the samples with spatial resolution typical of tem analyses , by selecting electrons with a well defined energy from the transmitted beam . before the cross - sectional tem analyses of the samples with au on sio2 , a thin sio2cap - layer ( 3 nm ) was deposited ( by sputtering with the aja rf magnetron apparatus ) on the samples in order to protect the ncs during the samples preparation .\nit is worth to note that this last deposition was performed at room temperature , so that we can assume that the au ncs do not change their atomic structure and equilibrium shape in consequence of the sio2protective - layer deposition because it is quite improbably that they release energy during such a process .\nrutherford backscattering spectrometry analyses allowed to determine the deposited au atomic surface densityq : for all the samples ( au in and on sio2 , as - deposited and annealed ) it is the same ( within a statistical error of 5% ) and equal to q  9  10 au / cm .\nso , we can conclude that no au loss occurs during thermal treatments ( evaporation , out - diffusion ) .\nplan- and cross - sectional tem analyses allowed to follow the evolution of the ncs size distribution as a function of annealing temperature and time . as an example , fig .\nfigure 1a and b refer to the samples annealed at 873 k for 20 min but with au ncs within and over the sio2 layer , respectively .\nfigure 1c and d show the images for the au ncs in and on sio2 annealed at 1073 k for 60 min .\nthe inset of each figure shows the derived ncs size distribution , reproduced by a gaussian fit ( continuous line ) , and the relative mean radius < r > , derived as the position of the gaussian peak . the error on <\nr > was evaluated as the standard deviation  ( 1/2 of the full width at half maximum ) of the gaussian fit .\nthe systematic behavior observred consists in an increase of the mean ncs radius ( translation of the radius distribution towards higher sizes ) and a decrease of  ( narrowing of radius distribution ) when annealing temperature and/or time are increased .\nthe systematic analyses of the evolution of such a distribution as a function of annealing temperature and time allowed to elucidate the kinetic growth mechanism ( in the analyzed annealing temperature and time range ) of the au ncs in and on sio2 in a ripening process of three - dimensional structures limited by diffusion but with different growth rates . in particular , a lower growth rate for the ncs embedded in sio2 was found with respect to the growing ncs on sio2 as evident from the tem images and distributions in fig . 1 ( and considering that the starting distributions for the ncs in and on sio2 are identical ) .\nin particular , we determined the increase of the mean radius < r > from ( 1.24  0.16 ) nm to ( 2.95  0.09 ) nm for the au ncs in sio2 and to ( 3.15  0.06 ) nm for those supported on sio2 ( in the same range of annealing temperature and time ) .\nthe detailed study of the kinetic growth mechanisms of au ncs on sio2 are reported by ruffino et al .   and\nfor the au ncs in sio2 by de marchi et al .   and miotello et al .\nplan - tem images of the samples ( a ) with au ncs inside the sio2 layer and annealed 873 k20 min , ( b ) with au ncs over the sio2 layer and annealed 873 k20 min , ( c ) with au ncs inside the sio2 layer and annealed 1073 k60 min , ( d ) with au ncs over the sio2 layer and annealed 1073 k60 min .\nthe inset of each figures show the obtained ncs radius distribution ( n is the normalized number of ncs and r the ncs radius , < r > the mean nc radius ) ncs internal structures and morphologies were examined using fresnel contrast and hr - tem analyses .\nthe first result was obtained by analyses on significant statistical population of ncs ( were analyzed 100 ncs for each sample ) : their internal atomic structures and shapes are determined only by their size and not by the particular annealing process performed .\nthis fact means that each sample is characterized by a distribution of ncs size ( which mean value increases when annealing temperature and time increase ) but in all the samples with au ncs inside sio2 , independently from the temperature , the smaller ncs have a similar structure between them , the greater ncs are a similar structure between them but different with respect to the smaller ones .\nthe same situation occurs for the ncs over sio2 but in a different manner from those grown inside the sio2 layer .\nin particular , for the au ncs embedded in sio2 , the hr - tem images indicate that , in the range of radius 1 nm < r < 3.5 nm the ncs always exhibit a single - crystal - icosahedral structure ( close - packing of atoms structure )   free of internal defects as indicated by the representative hr - tem images in fig .\n2a , b and c ( more complex different structures , such as marks decahedra or cuboctahedra , are evident for higher sizes ) .\nthese images refer to the samples as - deposited ( a ) , annealed 873 k60 min ( b ) and 1073 k60 min ( c ) , respectively .\nthey show a good resemblance with the proposed model for au ncs structure viewed along ( 110 ) .\nthe spacing between the crossing ( 111 ) planes is 0.235 nm in this projection and the au - au distance is 0.25 nm .\nthe fact that all the ncs in sio2 , with size in this range , exhibit single - crystal - icosahedral structure , free of internal defects reflects a situation in which their equilibrium shape symmetry is conserved when they grow .\nhr - tem images of au ncs in sio2 with the same size as the ncs on sio2 forming the three determined groups also the hr - tem images of the ncs deposited and annealed over sio2show a good resemblance with the proposed model for au ncs structure viewed along ( 110 ) but , differently from the ncs growing in sio2 , the data seem to delineate three large groups of structures , determined by the ncs size ( in the same size range 1 nm < r < 3.5 nm ) : group 1 ( a representative nc in fig .\n3a ) : it is formed by ncs with a radius r < 1.5 nm ; they have single - crystal - icosahedra structure   free of internal defects ; hr - tem images of au ncs on sio2 for the three determined groups ( ( a ) relative to the group 1 , ( b ) to the group 2 and ( c ) to the group 3 ) group 2 ( representative nc in fig .\n3b ) it is formed by ncs with a radius 1.5 nm   < r < 2 nm ; they have a ( 111)-twinned icosahedral structure ; group 3 ( representative nc in fig .\n3c ) : it is formed by ncs with a radius 2 nm   < r   <   3.5 nm ; they have a complicate decahedral multi - twinned ( and lamellar ) structure . from the representative images reported in fig .\n3 ( that refer to the samples as - deposited ( a ) , annealed 873 k60 min ( b ) and 1073 k60 min ( c ) , respectively ) it is clear that the evolution in size of the supported ncs on sio2 corresponds to an evolution of the equilibrium shape with a progressive loss of symmetry and a corresponding introduction of internal defects . in this figure , were reported representative images of ncs with size similar to those reported in fig .\n2 to make a direct comparison : the nc in fig . 3a ( representative of the group 1 of growing ncs on sio2 ) has an atomic structure ( single icosahedral ) coincident with those showed in fig .\n2a , b and c ( growing ncs in sio2 ) ; images in fig . 3b and c show ncs representative of the growing ncs on sio2 belonging to the group 2 and 3 , respectively : it is evident the different atomic structure in comparison with the ncs grown in sio2 and with similar sizes ( fig .\nthe ncs of group 2 , despite the similar single - crystal - icosahedral structure as the ncs of group 1 , are characterized by the introduction of twins of ( 111 ) planes corresponding to introduction of asymmetry in the nc shape .\nfor the ncs of group 3 occurs a transition from the icosahedral structure to the decahedral one , characterized by the introduction of multi - twins and completely lost shape symmetry .\nto explain the differences observed in the atomic structure and equilibrium shape of au ncs with similar size but grown inside and over the amorphous sio2layer , in this section we illustrate a discussion based on thermodynamic and symmetry considerations .\nin particular , we base our discussion on the concept of angular and radial symmetry / asymmetry of the nc surface free energy corresponding to a symmetrical / asymmetrical spatial situation of the environment surrounding the nc . furthermore , we correlate the angular / radial symmetric / asymmetric behaviour of the nc surface free energy with the rotational / translational invariance of the surface stress tensor of the nc . in the bulk form\nau has the face centred cubic ( fcc ) structure which is closest packed . as a consequence\nau macro - crystals exhibit the symmetric cubic , octahedral or rhombododecahedral crystal form associated with the fcc structure .\nfor the au ncs the situation is more complicated because the strongly influence of the surface atoms .\nthe fcc au based ncs generally present to the environment as a combination of crystal facets of the { 111 } and { 100 } planes in icosahedral or decahedral structure that yield to an efficient compromise between surface area and packing .\nit is known , furthermore , that the surface of au shows a tendency to reconstruct so that the surface atoms are closely packed together .\nthis behaviour could be due to the relief of large tensile surface stress in the unreconstructed surface .\nthe most striking reconstruction was observed in the ( 111 ) plane   ( that is expected to be the closest packing plane , the plane with the lowest surface free energy ) .\nsuch a plane forms a   reconstruction which appears to involve the insertion of an extra row of atoms into the surface every 23 rows .\nthis reconstruction clearly decreases the average coordination number of the atoms because to form it atoms must be taken from 12-fold - coordinated bulk sites placed in 9-fold - coordinated surface sites .\nsuch a reconstruction could only be lower in energy than the unreconstructed surface if the shorter bond - lengths that are formed in the plane of the surface are energetically favourable .\nthen , the unreconstructed au ( 111 ) surface exhibit a considerable tensile surface stress and the driving force for the   reconstruction is the relief of this tensile surface stress . in our discussion , we , according to shuttleworth   and cammarata , define the second rank surface stress tensor fij of the nc by:(1 ) being  the surface free energy ( per unit area ) of the nc , ij the surface elastic strain tensor , ij the kronecker delta .\nthen , we extracted quantitative data on the surface free energy from the ncs shapes via the inverse wulff construction : first , we identified the \nwulff point  of the nc and then applied the wulff construction in reverse order to obtain the surface energy plot to within a constant scale factor .\nthe wulff point (  center of mass  ) of a nc was defined as the intersection point between the perpendicular bisectors of two ( 111 ) facets .\nthis point was taken as the centre of a polar plot , with angular and radial coordinates  and r. for each i ( with a 5 spacing ) , we measured the distance ri between the wulff point and the nc surface ( determined by the accurate analyses of the hr - tem images ) . according to the wulff relation i /ri\n=  = const , the value of the surface free energy i   ( i ) for those orientations was obtained . in this way\nin particular , to make a direct comparison between the ncs on and in sio2 , we distinguished the nc surface in two parts .\nwe draw the line passing through the wulff point and parallel to the substrate plane ( using , in particular , cross - tem images ) . for the ncs on sio2\n, the ncs surface above this line was defined as the surface exposed to the ar ( the gas environment in which were performed the annealing processes ) , while the below one as the surface exposed to sio2 . in the same way for the ncs in sio2 , but considering that the upper and lower parts of surface are anywhere exposed to sio2 . according to this consideration , we named up (  ) the nc surface energy relative to the upper surface part and down (  ) the nc surface energy relative to the bottom part , so that for the ncs on sio2 is up (  )  au / ar (  ) and   (  ) , while for the ncs in sio2 is   and . for each class of ncs shapes ( fig . 2 and fig .\n3 ) , an averaged  (  ) plot is shown in fig . 4 and fig . 5 , where the relative energies are normalized to the surface free energy for the ( 111 ) plane . for all the plots the zero in the angle scale\nwas taken as the direction of one ( 111 ) plane of the nc . however , the ri values for each i are averaged over 10 different ncs belonging to the same group ( i.e. similar size ) . the nc - to - nc variation in  (  ) for a given orientation\nwulff plot   and   for the ncs in sio2 , with the same size as the ncs on sio2 forming the three determined groups first we consider the case of au ncs in sio2 : from fig .\n4a , it is clear that the peaks and valleys in the up (  ) and down (  ) lie in identical angular position ( angular symmetry of  (  ) ) and assume identical values .\nthe latter point means that the facets with the same miller indexes in the upper and lower parts of the nc , respectively , have identical radial coordinates ( radial symmetry of  (  ) ) .\nboth the angular and radial symmetry of  (  ) are conserved with increasing the cluster size in the cases of ncs in sio2 , as it is evident from the comparison of fig .\n4a , b and c. this fact is reflected in the invariance of fij both for translational and rotational transformations and , as a consequence , in the symmetrical single crystal icosahedral structure for the equilibrium shape of ncs in sio2 .\nthose ncs grow subjected always only to the thermodynamic process determined by the au / sio2 interface in any direction , i.e. in an \n5a shows , for the smaller sizes ( group 1 ) , a situation similar to the case of ncs in sio2 , i.e. up (  ) and down (  ) lying in identical angular position and assuming identical values ( : both angular and radial symmetry of  (  ) is present ( fij is again invariant both for translational and rotational transformations ) . however , differently from the ncs in sio2 , for sizes relative to the group 2 , the angular symmetry of  (  ) is still conserved , but the radial one begins to be lost ( , i.e. fij is invariant for rotational transformation but not for the translational ones .\nin fact , the ncs growing on sio2 are subjected to two thermodynamic competitive processes , due to the different surface energies of the au / ar interface ( up( ) = au / ar( ) ) and of the au / sio2 interface ( .\nthis is reflected in a progressive loss of symmetry in the ncs equilibrium shape with increasing the cluster radius beyond a \nin particular , both the angular and radial symmetry of  (  ) are lost for the ncs of group 3 ( fig .  \n3c ) , where any correspondence between up (  ) and down( ) is not present ( both the rotationally and translationally invariance of the fij are lost ) .\nfurthermore , the different surface energies at au / ar and au / sio2 interfaces determine during the ncs growth an internal strain accumulation , which is released in the formation of internal defects for larger sizes as indicated by mller and kern .\nwulff plot ( up( ) = au / ar( ) and   for the three groups of ncs on sio2 ( ( a ) relative to the group 1 and representative nc in fig .\n3c ) obviously , our data are consistent with the expectation that fcc nano - structured au present to the environment in icosahedral or decahedral structure with the { 111 } planes being the closest packing planes with the lowest surface free energy .\non the other hand , previous calculations [ 35 - 37 ] showed that for noble metals , such as au , the ratio of the surface energies (100)/(111 ) is close to the value of the broken - bound rule considering only the next - neighbor broken bonds .\nfor the ( 111 ) au there are three broken bounds for each surface atom and four for each atom of the ( 100 ) , so that should be . our data ( for example in fig .\n4a ) give  ( 100)/ ( 111 )  1.167  0.018 , in good agreement with this prediction .\nfinally , it is worth to note that , simply by our tem analyses , we are not to able to correlate experimentally the nc s surface / interface energy with its surface / interface atomic density .\nhowever , the link between the surface / interface energy and the surface / interface atomic density of the ncs is possible within the theoretical framework proposed by qi et al . .\nsuch an approach request the determination of the size - dependent cohesive energy of the ncs . the data concerning this determination and the link between the surface / interface energy and the surface / interface atomic density of the ncs by this theoretical framework will be the topic of a next specific paper .\nwe studied the effect of the surrounding environment on the atomic structure and equilibrium shape of growing ncs , considering the particular case of au ncs in / on amorphous sio2 .\nstarting from hr - tem analyses , quantitative data on the surface free energy of the ncs were extracted by the inverse wulff construction .\nenvironment exhibit an angular and radial symmetrical surface free energy function  (  ) making rotationally and translationally invariant the surface stress tensorfijof the nc : this situation determines a symmetrical equilibrium shape of the ncs . growing ncs in a \nnon - isotropic  environment exhibit a  (  ) that lost its angular and radial symmetry for sufficiently large sizes determining the loss of the rotationally and translationally invariance of thefijand , as a consequence , a loss of symmetry in the equilibrium shape of the nc and the formation of internal defects .\nthe results suggest that ideal crystalline nanoclusters can be grown on surfaces simply controlling the surrounding environment even by deposition of thin layers of materials as the bulk surface ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " we report on the equilibrium shape and atomic structure of thermally -

down of vegf in mscs increases lamin a protein expression whereas reduced vegf protein levels are detected upon the loss of one lmna allele in mscs .\nfurthermore , both lamin a and vegf appear to control osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation by regulating the levels of the osteoblast and adipocyte transcription factors runx2 and ppar , respectively . the precise mechanisms of intracrine vegf function in bone marrow mscs are not yet clear . furthermore , whether intracrine vegf requires binding and/or activation of vegf receptors to control bone marrow stem cell fate is not known . finally , since osteoblastic cells are known to stimulate osteoclastogenesis and angiogenesis by paracrine vegf - dependent mechanisms ( 27 , 30 , 31 ) ( fig .\n5 ) , an important question is whether and/or how the cells control the balance between paracrine and intracrine vegf functions during embryonic development and postnatal growth and aging .\nconfocal microscopy of bone marrow -

reassuring fetal heart rate presents . in the current study\n, uterine hyperstimulation was detected to be almost twice more frequent in the sublingual group , and also the number of the women who needed cesarean section for fetal distress was higher in the sublingual group than in the vaginal group , which is in agreement with the results of a study by feitosa et al . in both studies , however , the values were not statistically significant .\na systematic review based on 5 randomized clinical trials found that the risk of uterine tachysystole with sublingual misoprostol , compared to the vaginal route , was increased .\nlate fetal heart rate deceleration and meconium -

period where the individual received insulin at their index dose range or higher .\nfinally , hypoglycemia was captured by receipt of a diagnosis for the condition ( icd-9-cm codes of 251.0x251.2x ; 270.3x , 775.0x , 775.6x , or 962.3x ) .\nmultivariable analyses were used to examine the relationship between the outcomes of interest and index insulin dosage .\nall analyses controlled for the individual patient s characteristics ( age , sex , region of residence , insurance coverage , and type of diabetes ) , pre - period general health status , comorbidities , antidiabetic medication use , and resource use .\ngeneral health was proxied by the charlson comorbidity index ( cci).20,21 pre - period comorbid diagnoses of interest included retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy , coronary artery disease , peripheral vascular disease , coronary heart disease , hypertension , depression , obesity , and malignancy .\nmedication use during the pre - period encompassed any prescription that was filled for an oad agent , a non - insulin injectable , or an insulin pen , pump , or vial .\nan indicator variable for visits to an endocrinologist in the pre - period was also included .\nmeans and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables ( ie , descriptive statistics ) were used to characterize the sample .\nt - statistics and chi - square statistics were used to test for statistically significant differences between the cohorts .\ngeneral linear models with a gamma distribution and log link were used to examine the costs .\ntwo - part models were used to examine inpatient and er costs , where the first part captured the probability of using the service and the second part estimated the costs among users of the service .\nresource utilization was examined by estimating negative binomial regression , while logistic regressions analyzed the likelihood of achieving a pdc threshold of 80% or a hypoglycemic event .\nresults revealed that as the dose increased , the mean age of the patient decreased and the percentage of males increased .\nin addition , as the index dose increased , patients overall health generally worsened , as evidenced by the higher mean charlson score and the greater percentage of individuals diagnosed with neuropathy , coronary artery disease , or obesity .\npatients with a higher index dose were also generally more likely to have visited an endocrinologist in the pre - period and to have point - of - service insurance .\npatients with the lowest index dose were found to have the highest rates of depression and malignancy in the pre - period . finally , patients treated with the highest or lowest dosage of insulin were least likely to be identified as having t1 dm .\ntable 2 reveals antidiabetic medication use , based upon index dose , both at the index date and during the pre - period .\nas index dosage increased , patients during the post - period were more likely to be prescribed a basal and bolus insulin , a basal and premix insulin , a bolus and premix , or a basal and bolus and premix concurrently , but were less likely to be prescribed only basal or only bolus insulin .\nsimilarly , in the pre - period , increases in index dosage were associated with greater use of insulin in general , more use of basal , bolus , or analog insulin in particular , higher likelihood of using insulin delivered via pen or vial , greater likelihood of using an injectable other than insulin ( ie , a glucagon - like peptide-1 or an amylin agonist ) , and an increased likelihood of using any type of antidiabetic medication . however , as the index dose increased , individuals became less likely to have been prescribed an oad or a non - insulin injectable ( glucagon - like peptide-1 analogues and amylin analogues ) during the pre - period .\ntable 3 focuses on the association between the index dose and total direct medical costs .\nresults revealed that as the index dosage increased , both all - cause and diabetes - related drug costs and diabetes - related total costs increased .\nall - cause and diabetes - related er costs were highest among the lowest dose patients .\nall - cause and diabetes - related inpatient and all - cause outpatient costs were highest among the lowest and highest dose cohorts .\noverall , non - drug costs constituted a larger share of total medical costs in the lower dose cohorts .\nfor example , among individuals with an index dose of 10100 units of insulin / day , non - drug costs accounted for 79.54% of direct medical costs and 73.99% of direct diabetes - related medical costs .\nin contrast , among individuals with an index dose > 300 units of insulin / day , non - drug costs accounted for 61.76% of direct medical costs and 39.91% of direct diabetes - related medical costs .\ntable 4 examines the differences in resource utilization associated with index insulin use . in general , these results are consistent with the cost results presented in table 3 .\nfor example , the lowest dose cohort had the highest number of er visits . the lowest and highest dose cohorts had the longest mean hospital length of stay for any cause or for a diabetes - related cause , as well as the largest mean number of any - cause hospitalizations .\nfinally , figures 1 and 2 examine the probability of achieving a pdc threshold of at least 80% or having a hypoglycemic event in the post - period .\nresults revealed that compared to patients with an index dose of 10100 units / day , patients who received a higher index dose were significantly less likely to achieve a pdc threshold of at least 80% .\nhowever , among patients prescribed > 100 units of insulin / day , there was little difference in the likelihood of achieving the pdc threshold .\nfor example , patients with an index dose > 150200 units / day had a 95% reduction in the likelihood of achieving a threshold of 80% ( odds ratio = 0.047 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 0.0370.057 ) , while those with an index dose > 200300 units / day were 94% less likely to achieve this threshold ( odds ratio = 0.056 ; 95% ci 0.0440.071 ) .\nfigure 2 illustrates that there was little association between index insulin dose and probability of a hypoglycemic event in the post - period , with one exception : patients with an index dose > 100150 units / day were significantly more likely to have had a hypoglycemic event ( odds ratio = 1.171 ; 95% ci 1.0501.307 ) compared to patients with an index dose of < 100 units / day .\nin 2012 , persons 65 years of age or older were responsible for 59% of all diabetes - related expenditures in the united states , as well as the majority of diabetes - related resource use , including hospital inpatient days ( 63% ) , nursing / residential facility days ( 80% ) , hospice days ( 91% ) , outpatient physician visits ( 57% ) , and drug prescriptions ( 60%).9 to add to the current knowledge about this costly subgroup of patients , the present study examined the associations between insulin dosing and descriptive statistics , including age , sex , and general health , among a sample of patients 65 years of age or older with either t1 dm or t2 dm .\nin addition , this investigation looked at the connections between dosing and outcomes , including costs , resource use , hypoglycemic events , and adherence .\nthe main results of this study revealed significant links between insulin dosing and specific patient characteristics as well as between dosing and costs and resource use .\nin this study , men tended to have higher index insulin doses than women , consistent with the fact that men are , on average , larger than women in any population,22 and that insulin dosing has been found to be positively correlated with body weight as well as significantly higher in males compared to females.23 among this sample of elderly patients , increasing age was linked to lower insulin dose , a finding which reflects american diabetes association ( ada ) and european association for the study of diabetes ( easd ) treatment guidelines , which state :  if lower targets can not be achieved with simple interventions ( among patients 65 years of age and older ) , an hba1c of < 7.5%8.0% may be acceptable , transitioning upward as age increases and capacity for self - care , cognitive , psychological and economic status , and support systems decline.24,25 likewise , previous research has also found that insulin dose is negatively related to age.23 this finding is consistent with evidence that women live longer than men26 as well as with research that found that hypoglycemia rates have been increasing for the elderly,27 suggesting a potential benefit associated with lower dosing of insulin among the elderly .\nthe descriptive statistics revealed that patients with t2 dm were more likely to receive both the highest and lowest insulin dose ranges .\nthe receipt of relatively low dosages of insulin is consistent with research that found that insulin used adjunctively with oral medications may require a lower dose relative to insulin monotherapy.28 furthermore , this hypothesis is consistent with the finding that those in the lowest dose range were most likely to receive an oad and received the highest mean number of oad medications .\nthe receipt of the highest doses of insulin among those with t2 dm is consistent with previous research that has found patients with t2 dm were 3.13 times more likely to be classified as obese compared to those with t1dm.29\nas the index dose increased , the patients in this study tended to have more comorbid diagnoses and a higher likelihood of a diagnosis of neuropathy , coronary artery disease , or obesity .\na seemingly contradictory finding was that a pre - period diagnosis of hypertension , depression , or malignancy was associated with the  lowest  index insulin dose .\nalthough apparently at odds , these observations may be explained by earlier research which has characterized comorbidities among patients with diabetes as concordant , discordant , or dominant .\nspecifically , concordant comorbidities , such as cardiovascular disease , are illnesses which overlap with diabetes in their pathogenesis and management plans , while discordant comorbidities , such as mental illnesses , have unrelated pathogenesis and management plans.30 dominant illnesses , such as cancer , are those illnesses whose severity eclipse all other illness management plans.30 given that research has shown that concordant comorbidities are associated with better diabetes care , while discordant or dominant illnesses are associated with diminished diabetes care,31 the findings that depression and malignancy are associated with lower doses of insulin suggest that patients with these conditions may be undertreated with insulin .\nthe patients receiving the lowest dosages in this study had the greatest acute care ( inpatient and er ) costs and acute care usage , including the highest number of er visits , the largest all - cause er costs , and the highest diabetes - related er costs .\nin addition , the lowest dose cohort had the greatest all - cause and diabetes - related inpatient costs , the longest mean hospital length of stay for any cause or for a diabetes - related cause , and the largest mean number of any - cause hospitalizations .\nthese outcomes indicate that the lowest dose cohort had poorly controlled diabetes , likely due to what has been defined as \nprevious research has suggested that the knowledge and attitude of health care providers , as well as fear of hypoglycemia , may be reasons for such undertreatment.32 while there are potential benefits of lowering insulin doses , especially among the elderly , this research suggests that there are also potential costs in terms of increased hospitalization and er visits . despite having the highest acute care use and costs ,\nthe lowest dose cohort had the lowest all - cause and diabetes - related drug and total costs . however , as it has been argued , it is important to distinguish between  expectable  and  unexpectable  medical costs in the treatment of any chronic disease.33 \nexpectable  costs are those incurred to support comprehensive and continuous care and tend to reflect patients engagement in their treatment .\nsuch costs often include routine outpatient care , various medical tests and supplies , and medications.33 in contrast , \nunexpectable  costs are those incurred for acute or intensive care , such as er services and hospitalization .\nacute care use is often linked to poorer long - term treatment outcomes,34,35 and acute care has been shown to be avoidable through the use of appropriate expectable outpatient care.33,36 as the lowest dose cohort comprised a large majority of patients in the overall sample ( 32,325 out of 43,547 ) , our findings indicate that the costs of the undertreatment of diabetes are experienced not only by the individual patient but also by the overall health care system , which must struggle to keep up with the unpredictable and intensive needs of these patients . finally , the highest dose patients had the largest total health care costs , due mostly to their very high drug costs .\nin addition , the highest dose cohort was second only to the lowest dose cohort in having the highest acute care use and costs .\nsince the highest dose patients had the greatest burden of comorbid diagnoses , as well as a higher likelihood of having neuropathy , coronary artery disease , or obesity , it is possible that these individuals had advanced cases of diabetes , which tends to worsen over time due to the progressive decline of pancreatic -cell function.37 it has been noted in the literature that  failure of -cell function in the late stages of the disease is further compounded by the complications of diabetes and by the likelihood of significant comorbidities in elderly patients.37 the highest dose cohort also may have had insulin resistance , given that the use of > 200 units of insulin / day is a marker of insulin resistance,38 and this group used > 300 units / day .\nprevious literature has noted a reluctance to prescribe and use very high doses of u-100 insulin as well as a reduced physiological response among patients on such regimens;38 this evidence may help to explain the poor outcomes among the highest dose patients in our study . in any case , the findings indicate that patients with u-100 insulin doses > 300 units / day constitute a unique treatment subgroup whose diabetes may not be adequately controlled .\nit has been suggested that the use of u-500 may improve the likelihood of achieving optimal glycemic control among extremely insulin - resistant patients such as the highest dose patients in the present population.38\nmedication adherence has been shown to be the single factor with the greatest impact on treatment costs , in studies where adherence was proxied by the medication possession ratio.39,40 in the present study , the lowest index dose ( < 100 units / day ) was associated with improved adherence ( ie , a pdc threshold of at least 80% ) .\nthis finding supports earlier evidence that adherence to antidiabetic therapies tends to decrease as treatment complexity increases.4042 furthermore , the relatively poor adherence among high - dose cohorts is consistent with research suggesting that adherence among this group may be improved by utilizing strategies to lower the daily injection burden , such as using an insulin pump43 or using u-500 insulin.43,44 hypoglycemic events are a serious potential consequence of insulin therapy , and such events have been linked to significant humanistic and economic costs.32 this study found no association between index insulin dose and the likelihood of experiencing a hypoglycemic event , with the exception that those with an index dose of > 100150 units / day were more likely to experience a hypoglycemic event compared to those with an index dose of 10100 units / day . while this finding is inconsistent with the literature which has reported higher rates of hypoglycemia with intensive insulin therapy,45 it may reflect the limitation of relying upon diagnostic codes to identify hypoglycemia .\ngiven the research that has found that fear of hypoglycemia is a common cause for not adjusting insulin dose upward among individuals with t1 dm and hba1c higher than 8.5%,46 the finding in this study that there is not an increased risk of hypoglycemia as dose increases suggests that patients and/or physicians may wish to consider increasing insulin doses when appropriate .\nthe analyses were based on observational insurance claims data , which may affect the generalizability of the results .\nfirst , for instance , the claims database included only individuals with continuous medical and prescription benefit coverage , and insulin dosing categories resulted in unbalanced sample sizes .\nsecond , the use of diagnostic codes is not as rigorous as formal assessments and may underrepresent certain conditions or events ( eg , obesity , hypoglycemia ) .\nthird , the use of claims data precluded an examination of associations between outcomes and non - documented factors such as race , body mass index , insulin sensitivity , or duration of diabetes .\nfourth , the dataset did not allow for an investigation of causes ( eg , of differences in dosing ) .\nfifth , the methodology precluded observation of the manner in which the insulin was self - administered ( eg , whether / how the individual patient may have self - adjusted the dosing ) and any related effects . furthermore , while the analyses were not conducted separately for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes , all multivariable analyses controlled for differences in diabetes type . finally , the analyses focused on statistical significance and were unable to determine whether differences in outcomes represented minimal clinically important changes .\nin this study , elderly adult patients with diabetes who were using the highest doses observed ( > 300 units / day ) constituted the smallest , but on average , most costly cohort of patients had the lowest adherence to index insulin dose .\nfor example , this cohort had the highest average drug and total direct medical costs as well as the second highest average acute care costs .\nanother key finding of this study indicates that a large majority of us elderly patients with diabetes may be undertreated .\nfor instance , all - cause inpatient and er costs , as well as diabetes - related inpatient and er costs , were highest among the largest cohort of individuals , who were treated with the lowest dose observed ( ie , an index dose of 10100 units / day ) , an observation which may indicate a humanistic and acute care burden associated with clinical inertia in the treatment of elderly persons with diabetes .\nfurthermore , a u - shaped pattern for average , all - cause costs ( except drug costs ) , diabetes - related inpatient costs , and resource use were also generally observed , with costs highest among those who received the lowest and highest index dose ranges .\nthese results suggest higher patient burden among those with the lowest and highest insulin doses and suggests that physicians may wish to pay particular attention to these two groups of elderly individuals ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " objectiveto examine costs , resource utilization , adherence , and hypoglycemic events among various doses of u-100 insulin regimens among elderly patients ( age 65 years ) diagnosed with diabetes.methodstruven health analytics medicare databases from january 1 , 2008 through december 31 , 2011 were utilized . \n general linear models with a gamma distribution and log link were used to examine costs , while logistic and negative binomial regressions were used to examine resource utilization and hypoglycemic events . \n analyses controlled for patient characteristics , pre -

maksimov et al .\n2011 ) , ( 2 ) competition for nutrients and suitable colonization of niches at the root surface ( stephens et al . , 1993 ; kamilova et al . 2005 ; validov s , 2007 , phd thesis , leiden university , the netherlands ) , ( 3 ) regulation of plant ethylene levels through the acc - deaminase enzyme , which can act to modulate the level of ethylene in a plant in response to stress imposed by the infection ( glick and bashan , 1997 ; van loon , 2007 ) , and ( 4 ) production of siderophores and antibiotics .\nthe ability of rhizobacteria to produce siderophores and metabolites contributing to antibiosis has been the focus of many studies dedicated to investigating pgpr ( maksimov et al . , 2011 ) .\nthe uptake of ferric ion via siderophore is largely used by pathogenic and non - pathogenic microorganisms from the soil , human body and marine environments .\nthe importance of siderophore is closely related to iron , which is an essential element for different biological processes ( crosa and walsh , 2002 ) . on the other hand , bacteria can produce a wide variety of compounds with antimicrobial activity used as defense systems . these include broad - spectrum antibiotics , lactic acid produced by lactobacilli , lytic agents such as lysozymes , numerous types of exotoxins and bacteriocins , which also have a bactericidal mode of action ( riley and wertz , 2002 ) .\nsiderophores , bacteriocins and antibiotics are three of the most effective and well known mechanisms that an antagonist can employ to minimize or prevent phytopathogenic proliferation .\nto satisfy nutritional requirements of iron , microorganisms have evolved highly specific pathways that employ low molecular weight iron chelators termed siderophores .\nsiderophores are secreted to solubilize iron from their surrounding environments , forming a complex ferric - siderophore that can move by diffusion and be returned to the cell surface ( andrews et al . , 2003 ) .\nthe active transport system through the membrane begins with the recognition of the ferric - siderophore by specific membrane receptors of gram - negative and gram - positive bacteria ( boukhalfa and crumbliss , 2002 ) .\nsiderophores can chelate ferric ion with high affinity , allowing its solubilization and extraction from most mineral or organic complexes ( wandersman and delepelaire , 2004 ) .\nin aerobic conditions at physiological ph , the reduced ferrous ( fe ) form is unstable and is readily oxidized to the oxidized ferric ( fe ) form , which normally occurs as a poorly soluble iron hydroxide basically unavailable to biological systems ( krewulak and vogel , 2008 ; osorio et al . , 2008 ) .\nsiderophores can be defined as small peptidic molecules containing side chains and functional groups that can provide a high - affinity set of ligands to coordinate ferric ions ( crosa and walsh , 2002 ) . based on their iron - coordinating functional groups , structural features and types of ligands ,\nbacterial siderophores have been classified into four main classes ( carboxylate , hydroxamates , phenol catecholates and pyoverdines ) ( crowley , 2006 ) .\nhundreds of siderophores have been identified and reported for cultivable microorganisms , some of which are widely recognized and used by different microorganisms , while others are species - specific ( crowley , 2006 ; sandy and butler , 2009 ) . in soil ,\nsiderophore production activity plays a central role in determining the ability of different microorganisms to improve plant development .\nmicrobial siderophores enhance iron uptake by plants that are able to recognize the bacterial ferric - siderophore complex ( masalha et al .\n2000 ; katiyar and goel , 2004 ; dimkpa et al . , 2009 ) and are also important in the iron uptake by plants in the presence of other metals such as nickel and cadmium ( burd et al . , 1998 ;\nhowever , it is still unclear if bacterial siderophore complexes can significantly contribute to the iron requirements of the plant .\nsiderophore production confers competitive advantages to pgpr that can colonize roots and exclude other microorganisms from this ecological niche ( haas and dfago , 2005 ) . under highly competitive conditions , the ability to acquire iron via siderophores may determine the outcome of competition for different carbon sources that are available as a result of root exudation or rhizodeposition ( crowley , 2006 ) .\namong most of the bacterial siderophores studied , those produced by pseudomonads are known for their high affinity to the ferric ion .\nthe potent siderophore , pyoverdin , for example , can inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi that present less potent siderophores in iron - depleted media in vitro ( kloepper et al .\na pseudobactin siderophore produced by p. putida b10 strain was also able to suppress fusarium oxysporum in soil deficient in iron ; this suppression was lost when the soil was replenished with iron , a condition that represses the production of iron chelators by microorganisms ( kloepper et al . , 1980b ) .\nrecent studies have demonstrated the suppression of soil - borne fungal pathogens through the release of iron - chelating siderophores by fluorescent pseudomonads , rendering it unavailable to other organisms ( loper , 1988 ; paulitz and loper , 1991 ; dwivedi and johri , 2003 ) .\nbesides siderophore production , the biocontrol abilities of pseudomonad strains essentially depend on aggressive root colonization , induction of systemic resistance in the plant , and production of antifungal antibiotics ( haas and keel , 2003 ) .\nthe production of one or more antibiotics is the mechanism most commonly associated with the ability of plant growth - promoting bacteria to act as antagonistic agents against phytopathogens ( glick et al . , 2007 ) .\nthe basis of antibiosis , activity of biocontrol based on secretion of molecules that kill or reduce the growth of the target pathogen , has become better understood over the past two decades ( dowling and ogara , 1994 ; whipps , 2001 ; lugtenberg and kamilova , 2009 ) .\nantibiotics encompass a heterogeneous group of organic , low - molecular - weight compounds that are deleterious to the growth or metabolic activities of other microorganisms ( duffy , 2003 ) . according to haas and dfago ( 2005 )\n, six classes of antibiotic compounds ( for which their modes of action are partly understood ) are better related to the biocontrol of root diseases : phenazines , phloroglucinols , pyoluteorin , pyrrolnitrin , cyclic lipopeptides ( all of which are diffusible ) and hydrogen cyanide ( hcn ; which is volatile ) .\nmore recently , lipopeptide biosurfactants produced by pseudomonas and bacillus species have been implied in biocontrol due to their potential positive effect on competitive interactions with organisms including bacteria , fungi , oomycetes , protozoa , nematodes and plants ( de bruijn et al .\n. numerous types of antibiotics have been isolated from fungal and bacterial strains and this diversity includes mechanisms of action that inhibit synthesis of pathogen cell walls , influence membrane structures of cells and inhibit the formation of initiation complexes on the small subunit of the ribosome ( maksimov et al . , 2011 ) .\npyrrolnitrin , the antibiotic produced by the p. fluorescens bl915 strain , is able to prevent the damage of rhizoctonia solani during damping - off of cotton plants ( hill et al . , 1994 ) .\nthe 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol ( dapg ) produced by pseudomonads , an effective and extensively studied antibiotic , causes membrane damage to pythium spp . and\nis particularly inhibitory to zoospores of this oomycete ( de souza et al . , 2003 ) .\nphenazine , also produced by pseudomonads , possesses redox activity and can suppress pathogens of plants such as f. oxysporum and gaeumannomyces graminis ( chin - a - woeng et al . , 2003 ) .\nthe p. chlororaphis pcl1391 strain , isolated from roots of tomato plants , synthesizes phenazine-1-carboxamide , which is able to release soluble iron from insoluble ferric oxides at neutral ph , raising the possibility that phenazines might contribute to iron mobilization in soils ( hernandez et al . , 2004 ; haas and dfago , 2005 ) .\nantibiotics , such as polymyxin , circulin and colistin , produced by the majority of bacillus ssp .\nare active against gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria , as well as many pathogenic fungi ( maksimov et al . , 2011 ) .\nthe b. cereus uw85 strain , which suppresses oomycete pathogens and produces the antibiotics zwittermicin a ( aminopolyol ) and kanosamine ( aminoglycoside ) , contributes to the bio - control of alfalfa damping off ( silo - suh et al . , 1994 ; he et al . , 1994 ) . regarding bacteria as biocontrol agents to act as a biological solution ,\nsome researchers have highlighted the use of sporulating gram - positive species such as bacillus and paenibacillus spp .\n, which can confer higher population stability during formulation and storage of inoculant products ( emmert and handelsman , 1999 ; kokalis - burelle et al . , 2005 ) .\nother molecules used in microbial defense systems are bacteriocins . according to a review by riley and wertz ( 2002 ) ,\nbacteriocins differ from traditional antibiotics in one critical way : they commonly have a relatively narrow killing spectrum and are only toxic to bacteria closely related to the producing strain .\nalmost all bacteria may make at least one bacteriocin , and many bacteriocins isolated from gram - negative bacteria appear to have been created by recombination between existing bacteriocins ( riley , 1993 ) .\nthe colicins , proteins produced by some strains of escherichia coli that are lethal for related strains , are the most representative bacteriocins produced by gram - negative bacteria . like colicin , a name derived from e. coli ,\nother bacteriocins have been thus defined and named , such as pyocins from p. pyogenes strains , cloacins from enterobacter cloacae , marcescins from serratia marcescens and megacins from b. megaterium ( cascales et al . , 2007 ) .\ninterestingly , bacteriocins from bacillus spp . are increasingly becoming more important due to their sometimes broader spectra of inhibition ( as compared with most lactic bacterial bacteriocins ) , which may include gram - negative bacteria , yeasts or fungi , in addition to gram - positive species , some of which are known to be pathogenic to humans and/or animals ( abriouel et al . , 2011 ) .\nnon - pathogenic rhizobacteria have been shown to suppress disease by inducing a resistance mechanism in the plant called  induced systemic resistance  ( isr ) ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) .\ninduced resistance is the state of an enhanced defensive ability developed by plants when appropriately stimulated ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) .\n( 1991 ) in carnation plants that was systemically protected by the p. fluorescens strain wcs417r against f. oxysporum f. sp .\n( 1991 ) in cucumber plants , where rhizobacterial strains protected the leaves against anthracnose caused by colletotrichum orbiculare .\nthe inducing rhizobacteria and the pathogens were inoculated and remained confined and spatially separated on the same plant so that microbial antagonism was excluded and the protective effect was plant - mediated .\nrhizobacteria - mediated isr resembles pathogen - induced systemic acquired resistance ( sar ) in that both types of induced resistance render uninfected plant parts more resistant to plant pathogens ( van wees et al .\n, 1997 ; van loon et al . , 1998 ) , including fungal , bacterial and viral pathogens , as well as nematodes and insects ( zehnder et al . , 1997 ; van loon et al . , 1998 ;\nthe same strain induces resistance against several pathogens in the same plant ( somers et al .\nvleesschauwer and hfte ( 2009 ) proposed the terminology isr to depict induced systemic resistance promoted by non - pathogenic rhizobacteria or pgpr , irrespective of the signaling pathway involved in this process , while the term sar is used to describe salicylic acid - dependent induced resistance triggered by a localized infection .\ninduction of sar is through salicylic acid ( sa ) and isr requires jasmonic acid ( ja ) and ethylene ( et ) signaling pathways ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) .\nthese accumulating signaling molecules coordinate the defense responses and when applied exogenously , are sufficient to induce resistance ( ryals et al . , 1996 ) .\nthe protection mediated by isr is significantly less than that obtained by sar ( van loon , 2000 ) and a degree of dependence on plant genotype is observed in the generation of isr ( bloemberg and lugtenberg , 2001 ) .\nhowever , isr and sar together provide a better protection than each of them alone , indicating that they can act additively in inducing resistance to pathogens ( van wees et al . , 2000 ) .\nsalicylic acid accumulation occurs both locally and , at lower levels , systemically , in line with the development of sar .\napplication of exogenous sa also induces sar in many plant species ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) .\ndevelopment of tissue necrosis used to be considered a common and necessary feature for sar activation ( vleesschauwer and hfte , 2009 ) , but in many cases , sar can also be triggered without tissue necrosis as demonstrated in arabidopsis thaliana ( mishina and zeier , 2007 ) . in sar ,\nsa activates specific sets of defense - related genes called pathogenesis - related proteins ( prs ) . generally , isr is not accompanied by the activation of pr genes .\nthe enhanced defensive capacity characteristic of sar is always associated with the accumulation of prs ( van loon , 2007 ) .\ntreatment of tobacco roots with p. fluorescens cha0 triggers accumulation of sa - inducible pr proteins in the leaves ( maurhofer et al . , 1994 ) .\nthese prs serve as hallmarks of sar in several plant species and are thought to contribute to the state of resistance attained ( vleesschauwer and hfte , 2009 ) .\nsome of these prs are 1,3-glucanases and chitinases capable of hydrolyzing fungal cell walls , while other prs are poorly characterized .\nsar - associated prs suggest an important contribution of these proteins to the increased defensive capacity of induced tissues ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) .\nthe pr-1 gene or protein expression appears to be inducible by sa and it is usually taken as a molecular marker to indicate that sar has been induced ( van loon and bakker , 2006 ) .\ntomato or sprayed with sa developed sar and accumulated pr-1 , -2 and -5 mrnas ( pieterse et al . , 1996 ) and inoculated with p. fluorescens wcs417r or p. putida wcs358 developed isr , but pr - gene expression or accumulation of prs was not detected ( van wees et al . , 1997 ) .\nisr can be triggered in plants that are unable to accumulate sa ( nahg mutant plants ) .\nbased on this , one can conclude that prs are induced concomitantly with sar , whereas sa and the activation of pr genes is not part of the pathway leading to isr in arabidopsis ( pieterse et al . , 1996 ) .\ntransduction of the sa signal requires the regulatory ( activator ) protein npr1 ( or nim1 ) that functions in the terminal part of the signaling pathway of sar ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) .\nin non - induced plants , npr1 is present as a multimer and during sar induction , sa triggers the conversion of npr1 into a monomeric form ( verhagen et al .\n2000 ) , where they interact with members of the tga / obf subclass of basic - leucine - zipper ( bzip ) transcription factors that are involved in sa - dependent activation of pr genes ( fan and dong , 2002 ; zhang et al .\na direct interaction between npr1 and a specific tga transcription factor is required for the binding of the complex to elements within the promoter of the pr genes ( desprs et al .\noverexpression of the npr1 gene leads to enhanced resistance to pathogen attack ( cao et al . , 1998 ; friedrich et al . ,\nthe arabidopsis mutant npr1 does not express pr genes and does not exhibit sar . since rhizobacteria - mediated isr is independent of sa and not associated with prs , it is expected that isr would still be expressed in this mutant . however\n, the npr1 mutant of arabidopsis does not display p. fluorescens wcs417r - mediated isr .\nthis implies that npr1 regulates defense responses mediated by different signaling pathways that function beyond the expression of pr genes , indicating that sar and isr converge at the last part of the signaling pathway ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) .\n( 1996 , 1998 , 2000 ) with the reference rhizobacterial strain p. fluorescens wcs417r demonstrated that , at least in arabidopsis , wcs417r - mediated isr functioned independently of sa , depended on npr1 , but required components of the ja and ethylene ( et ) response pathways .\ninfected plants increased their levels of ja and et as a sign of active defense ( de laat and van loon , 1982 ; gundlach et al .\nthese signaling molecules coordinate the activation of a large set of defense responses and when applied exogenously , can induce resistance themselves ( pieterse et al . , 1998 ) .\nthe dependency of isr on ja and ethylene is based on enhanced sensitivity to these hormones rather than on an increase in their production ( pieterse et al . ,\n2000 , 2001 ) . the arabidopsis ja response mutant jar1 and the et response mutant etr1 were tested in the development of isr .\nthe signal - transduction pathways leading to pathogen - induced sar and rhizobacteria - mediated isr in arabidopsis thaliana are summarized in figure 1 .\nmethyl jasmonate ( meja ) and the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate ( acc ) also promote resistance against p. syringae pv .\nbesides that , meja - induced protection is blocked in jar1 - 1 , etr1 - 1 and npr1 - 1 plants , whereas acc - induced protection is affected in etr1 - 1 and npr1 - 1 plants , but not in jar1 - 1 plants .\ntherefore , wcs417r - mediated isr follows a signaling pathway in which components from the ja and ethylene response pathways are successively engaged to trigger a defense reaction that , like sar , is regulated by npr1 ( pieterse et al . , 1998 ) .\none or more bacterial determinant must be recognized by specific plant receptors so that resistance is induced .\na variety of resistance - inducing molecules have been described : lipopolysaccharides and siderophores , including sa ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) , flagella , biosurfactants , n - acyl - homoserine lactones ( ahl ) , n - alkylated benzylamines , antibiotics and exopolysaccharides ( eps ) ( vleesschauwer and hfte , 2009 ) . the ability to develop isr in response to certain rhizobacteria has been demonstrated in several species of plants ( van loon et al . , 1998 ) and appears to depend on the specificity of the interaction between rhizobacteria and plants ( van loon , 2007 ) .\nfailure to elicit isr in certain hosts may be due to the absence of production of inducing components in the rhizosphere or an inability of the particular plant species to perceive such compounds ( van loon , 2007 ) .\nthe evidence support that it is necessary specific recognition between the plant and the rhizobacteria for induction of resistance .\nfor instance , pseudomonas putida wcs358r and p. fluorescens wcs374r act in different ways depending on the plant species : in arabidopsis , wcs358r elicits isr , but not in radish and carnation plants ( van peer et al . ,\n1991 ; van peer and schippers , 1992 ; leeman et al . , 1995 ; van wees et al . , 1997 ) .\nin contrast , radish plants are responsive to wcs374r , while arabidopsis is not ( leeman et al . , 1995 ; van wees et al . , 1997 ) .\nthe ability of bacterial siderophores and antibiotics to suppress phytopathogens could be of significant agronomic importance .\nboth mechanisms have essential functions in microbial antagonism but also are able to elicit induced resistance .\nresistance - inducing and antagonistic rhizobacteria might be useful in formulating new inoculants , offering an attractive alternative of environmentally friendly biological control of plant disease and improving the cropping systems into which it can be most profitably applied . these new pgpr will require a systematic strategy designed to fully utilize all these beneficial factors , applying combinations of different mechanisms of action allowing crop yields to be maintained or even increased while chemical treatments are reduced ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " bacteria that colonize plant roots and promote plant growth are referred to as plant growth - promoting rhizobacteria ( pgpr ) . \n pgpr are highly diverse and in this review we focus on rhizobacteria as biocontrol agents \n . their effects can occur via local antagonism to soil - borne pathogens or by induction of systemic resistance against pathogens throughout the entire plant . \n several substances produced by antagonistic rhizobacteria have been related to pathogen control and indirect promotion of growth in many plants , such as siderophores and antibiotics . \n induced systemic resistance ( isr ) in plants resembles pathogen - induced systemic acquired resistance ( sar ) under conditions where the inducing bacteria and the challenging pathogen remain spatially separated . \n both types of induced resistance render uninfected plant parts more resistant to pathogens in several plant species . \n rhizobacteria induce resistance through the salicylic acid - dependent sar pathway , or require jasmonic acid and ethylene perception from the plant for isr . \n rhizobacteria belonging to the genera pseudomonas and bacillus are well known for their antagonistic effects and their ability to trigger isr . \n resistance - inducing and antagonistic rhizobacteria might be useful in formulating new inoculants with combinations of different mechanisms of action , leading to a more efficient use for biocontrol strategies to improve cropping systems .

the results show that it is significantly different between the two groups in the follow - up for 12 months ( md = 0.03 ; 95% ci = 0 to 0.05 ; p = 0.20 ) ( figure 7 ) .\nthe heterogeneities of se and iop were significant , and dropping eligible studies by hand and metaregression have not provided good results .\nthis systematic review provided a critical overview of previous clinical reports and combined effect measures of timolol in multiple small clinical trials to increase statistical power .\nit included six trials using timolol to prevent and treat the myopic regression after lasik .\nall trials were implemented in developing countries because of the higher incidence than developed countries .\nthere are still no large multicenter randomized trials to assess the efficacy and safety of timolol on the treatment of myopic regression . as a common clinical phenomenon\n, refractive regression can affect the predictability , efficiency , and long - term stability of refractive surgery and lead to deterioration in visual performance and even seriously affect the surgical curative effect and patients ' satisfaction .\nso the prevention and treatment of refractive back after the surgery are very important to the quality of patient 's life in the future . nevertheless , there are no unified and effective methods in the treatment of myopic regression .\nsecondary surgery is an inacceptable method for patients and doctors ; both of them have very big challenge .\nin contrast , effective drug treatment is a lower risk more easily accepted by patients .\nthere have been many factors which associated with myopic regression after lasik , including preoperative refraction [ 4 , 5 , 1923 ] , preoperative keratometry [ 20 , 21 , 24 ] , corneal thickness [ 11 , 23 ] , flap thickness [ 24 , 25 ] , ablation depth , optical zone size [ 21 , 26 ] , chronic dry eye , age , surgeon , iop [ 20 , 22 ] , postoperative undercorrection , and humidity .\nthe occurrence of refractive regression has the relation with the corneal wound healing response , the destruction of the corneal biomechanics structural integrity , and relatively high intraocular pressure and closely related to the occurrence of postoperative dry eye .\nkamiya and associates   present a theory to assess the effects of nipradilol , an iop - lowering agent ; pan et al .   compared regressive eyes with nonregression after lasik and indicated that refractive regression after lasik might be mainly induced by corneal protrusion , rather than central corneal thickening .\nthat is what happens with any refractive procedure or flap ; the corneal biomechanics changing may be a factor of the myopic regression . from these studies , we conclude that lasik can lead to the destruction of the corneal biomechanics structural integrity , corneal injury repair reshaping in the early postoperative stage , the strength of the corneal resistance reduced , intraocular pressure remaining unchanged , and intraocular pressure greater than the corneal resistance .\ntherefore , the bulging forward of the cornea that caused corneal diopter increasing is the primary cause of myopia refractive regression after lasik .\ntimolol as a kind of commonly used ocular hypotensive agent has a good clinical effect .\nso far , however , because of lasik postoperative corneal shape to the process and the fact that its mechanism is not clear , when we use timolol postoperatively , the use of the drug dose and time have not yet been determined .\nso this meta - analysis for the effects of timolol for prevention and treatment of refractive regression made a systematic review .\nthe results of this meta - analysis show that we can use the timolol eye drops to prevent and treat myopic patients undergoing lasik and occurring refractive regression .\nthe se in 5 trials mentioned have statistical differences between the timolol groups and the controlled groups ( p < 0.05 ) ; it declared the fact that the iop after lasik is one of the reasons for the se decline .\nthese results indicate that iop reduction may have induced a backward shift of the cornea and reduction of corneal refractive power , resulting in refractive improvement in post - lasik eyes .\nit may be that the morphologic properties of the cornea are affected easily by subtle changes in iop and atmospheric pressure when corneal rigidity is impaired by flap manipulation and laser ablation such as lasik .\nbut the cct in four trials have no significant differences between the timolol groups and the controlled groups ( p > 0.05 ) .\nthe result indicated that the corneal hydration may not play an important role in the refractive changes in these studies .\nthe iop , udva , and cdva in treated groups are significantly different from those in the controlled groups ( p < 0.05 ) .\nconcluded that the se , udva , and cdva improved in patients with myopic regression after timolol application compared with the control group and improvement lasted for at last 6 months after timolol was stopped .\nzhongwen   also chooses the follow - up for 6 months after lasik to compare because myopic regression can be stable in 6 months .\nfirst , the studies only have six trials ; it is not enough to analyse the outcome and it is easy to produce bias . in addition , some parameters had relatively large heterogeneity .\nthe heterogeneities of se and iop were not explained due to different surgical techniques , different methods of measurement , or different follow - up periods in different trials .\nhowever , we still believe that the results of this meta - analysis are useful , because the meta - analysis includes a relative large number of studies and cases which provide a strong power and the consonance of previous results and sensitivity analysis . in conclusion , timolol was effective for reduction and improvement of myopic regression especially the spherical errors after myopic lasik .\nimportantly , further rcts with large sample size are needed and the search for more effective and cheaper interventions for this trial would be necessary ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " \n aims . \n the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of timolol in the treatment of myopic regression after laser in situ keratomileusis ( lasik ) . \n methods . \n we searched medline , central , embase , china national knowledge infrastructure ( cnki ) , and chinese biological medicine ( cbm ) from the inception to july 2015 for relevant randomized controlled trials that examined timolol therapy for myopic regression . \n the methodological quality of the studies included was assessed using the revman 5.3 software . \n results . \n we included six clinical trials involving 483 eyes in this review , including 246 eyes in treated group and 237 eyes in controlled group . \n we observed statistically significant improvements on the postoperative se in the 3 months . \n however , the change of cct was not statistically different between the control group and the experimental group . \n there were fewer cases of iop , udva , and cdva in treated group having significant difference from the controlled group . \n conclusions . \n topical timolol could be an effective treatment for reduction of myopic regression especially the spherical errors after myopic lasik . \n further rcts with larger sample sizes for these trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and limitation for myopic regression after lasik .

time - consuming [ 14 - 18 ] .\nhowever , it is the first attempt to extend this novel reduction technique for the preparation of colloidal metal nanoparticles in aqueous solution .\ntherefore , as a first step , we employed the uv  vis , xps tem , and edx characterizations to confirm whether the metal ions in the aqueous solution could be reduced effectively into the metallic state . shown in fig .\n2 were the uv  vis absorbance spectra of aqueous haucl4 solution before and after plasma reduction . before the plasma reduction ( fig .\n2a ) , the solution displayed a strong absorption band at 217 nm and a shoulder at 287 nm , both of which were due to the ligand - to - metal charge transfer ( lmct ) bands of [ aucl4 ] ions between gold and chloro ligands [ 19 - 21 ] .\n2b ) , the lmct bands of the [ aucl4 ] decreased dramatically , suggesting that the au ions in haucl4 solution were effectively reduced into the metallic state . moreover , a broad band centered at about 550 nm , which was assigned to the plasmon band of au nanoparticles ( 210 nm ) , could be evidently observed .\nthe uv  vis results proved that , with the glow discharge plasma reduction , colloidal au nanoparticles could easily be synthesized from the aqueous haucl4 solution .\nthe uv  vis absorbance spectra of aqueous haucl4 solution a before and b after plasma reduction the chemical state of au species in the obtained colloids was also examined by the xps test .\n3 , two peaks were observed , and no other peaks could be deconvoluted . for the binding energy ,\nthe au 4f7/2 peak was centered at 83.1 ev and the au 4f5/2 peak at 86.7 ev , both of which were slightly lower than the standard values of the bulk au metal .\nthese slight negative shifts could be rationalized in terms of the unique microenvironments during the plasma reduction .\nit can be readily inferred from the xps results that the plasma reduction could effectively reduce the au ions into the metallic state .\nxps spectra of au 4f for plasma reduced colloidal au nanoparticles the representative tem images of au colloids were presented in fig .\n4 . figure 4a , 4b showed that spherical au nanoparticles were highly dispersed in the colloids with an average particle size of 3.64 nm ( standard deviation , sd = 0.86 nm ) . to visually observe the atomic structure of au nanoparticles ,\nthe lattice fringes with d = 0.235 nm were clearly visible , which could be attributed to the ( 111 ) planes of au .\nthis result was consistent with the aforementioned uv  vis and xps characterizations , suggesting the successful synthesis of colloidal au nanoparticles . the edx spectrum ( fig .\ntem results : a typical tem image of colloidal au nanoparticles ( scale bar : 20 nm ) ; b size distribution of colloidal au nanoparticles ( av is the average particle size , and sd denotes the standard deviation of the size distribution ) ; c high -

controlled synthesis of colloidal au nanoparticles would be crucial for their use as advanced materials in potential applications or as model materials in fundamental studies . in this new synthesis method ,\nthe initial concentration of the aqueous haucl4 solution was found to be a key parameter for the realization of size - controlled synthesis of colloidal au nanoparticles . as illustrated in fig . 5 , by increasing the initial concentration of haucl4 solution to 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 mm , spherical and mono - dispersed au nanoparticles with the average particle size of 5.88 , 7.95 , and 9.84 nm\n5 , with a standard deviation ( sd ) of 1.27 , 1.60 , and 1.67 nm , respectively . figure 6 clearly demonstrated that the size of colloidal au nanoparticles could be easily tuned in the nanometer range by adjusting the initial concentration of the haucl4 solution .\ntypical tem images and the corresponding size distributions of colloidal au nanoparticles synthesized by varying the initial concentration of the aqueous haucl4 solutions : a 1.0 mm , av = 5.88 nm , sd = 1.27 nm ; b 1.5 mm , av = 7.95 nm , sd = 1.60 nm ; c 2.0 mm , av = 9.84 nm , sd = 1.67 nm.scale bar : 50 nm .\nav is the average particle size , and sd denotes the standard deviation of the size distribution the relationship between the initial concentration of haucl4 solution and the average diameter of the obtained au nanoparticles it was reported that colloidal au nanoparticles exhibited a surprising activity in the glucose oxidation reaction under mild conditions .\ntherefore , we employed the glucose oxidation as the model reaction to test the catalytic activity of the synthesized au colloids .\nsince au colloids exhibited selectivity nearly 100% in the model reaction ( as determined by hplc ) , the conversion could be measured conveniently from the consumptions of naoh , which was added during reaction to maintain a constant ph value for the reaction medium . as shown in fig .\n7 , colloidal au nanoparticles ( dav = 3.64 nm ) behaved as an active catalyst allowing 52% glucose conversion in the first 30 min and reaching a plateau of 58% glucose conversion after 120 min .\nthis catalytic result was comparable with that reported in the literature , which provided 30% conversion in the first 15-min reaction .\ncatalytic activity of colloidal au nanoparticles in glucose oxidation reaction the mechanism for the radiation - induced reduction of aucl4 ions can be adopted to interpret the nucleation and growth of au nanoclusters in the present work .\nthese high - energy species can induce the dissociation and ionization of the water molecules in the aqueous solution to generate the reducing agents : the generated hydrated elections eaq serve as the reducing agents for the formation of gold nanoparticles : furthermore , the high - energy electrons play a key role in protecting the produced colloidal au nanoparticles from aggregation .\nthe plasma reduced au nanoparticles could retain some electric charge and repel each other , resulting in the uniform and stable distribution of au nanoparticles in the colloids .\nfurther investigations regarding the mechanism and kinetics of plasma reduction are being conducted for a better understanding .\nhighly dispersive and catalytically active colloidal gold nanoparticles were synthesized within only 5 min by the novel glow discharge plasma reduction technique .\nthe size of colloidal au nanoparticles could be easily tuned in the nanometer range by adjusting the initial concentration of haucl4 solution .\nthe as -

resolution ct would be not sufficient to evaluate cochlear function , and there will be a need for further studies . in this report , the longitudinal hearing threshold could be evaluated .\nbilateral mixed hearing loss was observed at the first visit and the type of hearing loss changed to bilateral conductive hearing loss at the second visit ( fig .\n1 ) . recurrent otitis media and its effects could be the cause of permanent sensorineural hearing loss in achondroplasia . in this case\n, the sensorineural component was improved at the second visit , so the effects of the otitis media may not have been a cause of the sensorineural hearing loss .\nswelling of the middle ear mucosa or the presence of granulation tissue around the oval window / round window could be the cause of the sensorineural hearing loss in otitis media , and the threshold of bone conduction can be improved when these factors are corrected by operation .\nalso slow development of the temporal bone can be the cause of the inappropriate examination of the bone conduction threshold .\nalthough the exact cause of changes of the bone conduction threshold could not be identified , it may have been due to improving conditions of the middle ear or the late development of the mastoid .\nconductive hearing loss was observed at the second visit and the cause of the conductive hearing loss was displacement of the prosthesis .\nthe initial ossicular state could not be evaluated to determine whether a congenital ossicular anomaly or secondary ossicular stiffness existed . in achondroplasia\n, structural abnormalities of the temporal bone can develop because of rotation of the medial structure .\nthe cochlea was upward rotated and the scutum was directed well below the promontory and basal turn of the cochlea . only the most inferior aspect of the promontory can be observed through the external auditory canal .\nalso , rotational changes affect the vestibule and related structures , so the oval window faces almost directly inferiorly .\nit can make it difficult to find the stapes and its superstructure during an operation .\nadequate analysis of the tbct before an operation , and procedures for visualization of the middle ear , such as canaloplasty , would be needed during an operation . in this case ,\ncuretting of the posterior - superior bony tympanic ring was used for visualization of the stapes head .\nalso drilling of the same portion of the external auditory canal could be useful for visualization of the stapes and care should be taken not to damage the tympanomeatal flap during drilling\n. a small piece of aluminium foil ( packing material of vicryl string ) can be used as a protector during the drilling .\nperforation of the tympanic membrane , adhesion of the perforation margin to the middle ear mucosa and stiffness of the ossicles were observed in the left ear .\nthese changes may have been due to the previous tympanostomy tube insertion and the frequent middle ear infections . despite lack of ossicular mobility ,\nthe air - bone gap was 18 db hl , and only tympanoplasty would have been effective .\nthe purpose of surgery is correction of the conductive hearing loss , and it was decided to correct the whole possible cause of the hearing loss during the operation .\nmalleo - stapedial interposition can preserve physiologic sound transmission and has shown a 66 - 85% success rate in many reports .\nadequate fitting of the prosthesis between the malleus handle and stapes head was possible during the operation , and ossiculoplasty rather than only tympanoplasty was performed .\nalthough a congenital ossicular anomaly could be possible considering the development of the ossicles , the incidence of ossicular anomaly is low\n. acquired ossicular stiffness can develop when repeated , persistent middle ear disease accompanies it and it can be the cause of conductive hearing loss .\nnormal ossicular continuity and acquired ossicular stiffness should be considered before suspecting an ossicular anomaly based on abnormal looking ossicles in the tbct , and sufficient evaluation and verification are needed before surgical treatment .\nalthough this is just one case report , it shows a typical finding of achondroplasia and a way of correcting the hearing loss in achondroplasia\n. it could be helpful to many clinicians who meet achondroplastic patients for choosing the appropriate surgical treatment ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " achondroplasia is the most common skeletal dysplasia and it combines various complications with normal longevity . hearing disturbance due to otitis media or an ossicular anomaly is one of the most common complications . \n conductive hearing loss is suggested as the most common form of hearing loss . \n temporal bone and middle ear structures are distorted in achondroplasia because of rotational change of the skull base . \n authors experienced a case of an achondroplastic patient with bilateral hearing disturbance . \n we faced making a potential mistake during the previous operation but a favorable postoperative result occurred . \n our experience could be helpful to other clinicians who face achondroplastic patients .

leishmania or potential immunomodulator agents in addition to conventional therapeutic regimens seem necessary .\nthis is the first trial evaluating a novel herbal medicine , imod , for treating experimental cl .  \n( 44 ) , spleen of dog and hamster is suitable organ for experimental inoculation because of higher parasite burden due to the low level of ifn-. so , in this experiment , we inoculated the suspension of live parasites derived from the spleen of donor dog to our dogs through i.v . injection . in this way ,\nthe natural process is accelerated and induces a stronger immunity response and more obvious clinical symptoms in dogs . for designing experimental studies , time and cost saving are the advantages of using the mentioned protocol ( 6 , 20 ) .  \nover 50 years , the use of chemotherapy , based on pentavalent antimonials , has made them as the first step for treating vl in both human and dogs .\nhowever , due to recently development of drug resistances associated with various leishmanial species ( 5 ) , the need for new agents is more emphasized .  \npentavalent antimonials inhibit two essential enzymes ( phosphofructokinase and dehydrogenase pyruvate ) for parasite survival ( 21 , 48 , 49 ) but in dogs has been mostly unsuccessful .\nalthough major clinical signs of disease disappear after treatment , this might not indicate the complete absence of parasites in spleen or bone marrow ( 30 ) .\ncombination of anti - leishmania agents with vaccines and/or immunomodulator drugs might enhance drug efficacy , stimulate patient immunity and reduce the potential adverse effects of conventional treatment ( 7 , 8 , 11 , 19 - 21 ) .\nthe complex nature of cl and its clinical manifestations make its management difficult . all the infected dogs in this experiment were categorized in stage ii and iii , based on staging of canine vl by leish - vet group ( 47 ) .\nthe most prominent clinical signs in this trial as also found in naturally infected dogs were lymphadenopathy and weight loss which could be seen along with other clinical signs or clinicopathological abnormalities ( 20 , 21 , 42 , 47 ) .   results of glucantime therapy ( group ii ) showed that some clinical signs such as pneumonia were disappeared 60 days after treatment period ; the other manifestations such as lymphadenopathy , lethargy and skin lesions reappeared 30 days after treatment .\nin group ii , reduction of anti - leishmania antibody titers were detected 60 days after treatment , however none of dogs in this group became seronegative ( < 1:320 ) at the end of study . in group iii ( glucantime plus imod ) ,\nalthough remission of clinical signs were seen 30 days after treatment followed by normal hematobiochemistry profiles and reduction of anti - leishmania antibodies after 60 days but negative serological results were not detected by the end of study .\nthese findings are also reported by other authors regarding different immune - chemotherapy protocols for cl ( 6 , 8 , 20 - 22 , 24 , 46 ) .   resistance to leishmaniasis\nis well known due to cell mediated immunity and the balance of the th1 ( il-2 , ifn- & tnf)/th2 ( il-10 & il-4 ) responses ( 20 , 21 , 24 , 42 ) .\nlack of cell reactivity particularly when specific antibody titers are high is confirmed in patients with acute vl .\nso , a treatment that provides clinical recovery and reduces anti - body titers , at least partially , is highly desirable ( 21 ) . at the end of monitoring period ( day 90 ) ,\none dog from groups ii and one in group iii were clinically treated as confirmed by the conversion of parasitological parameter and according to the clinical classification of leish - vet group ( 47 ) ; this finding was further confirmed by pcr negative results .\nthe clinical recovery in groups ii & iii could be related to the use of the glucantime and the immune - chemotherapy protocol and higher cellular reactivity to leishmanial antigens .  \nunlike group ii , dogs from group iii ( immune - chemotherapy ) showed clinical signs improvement in a shorter time ( approximately 30 days ) with no relapse . in group iv , imod administration as an immunomodulator drug was not associated with clinical adverse effects and the evaluation of hematological and biochemical ( renal and hepatic function and electrolytes ) tests showed no remarkable changes .\nshortly after imod therapy , decreasing in the spleen sizes were detected ( p=0.02 ) ; this finding may be associated with parasite load reduction .\nhowever based on parasitological and pcr evaluation , the imod had no effect for parasite elimination in this experiment .   in agreement with khorram khorshid et al .\n( 31 ) , histopathological evaluation for liver and spleen samples showed no significant differences with control groups ( table 2 ) .\nbased on some studies , the herbs and selenium in this complex have strong anti - oxidative stress potential and immunomodulator mettalo - enzyme , respectively ( 29 , 50 - 51 ) . as reported by other authors ( 35 ) , an important point that deserves further research was the observation that no adverse effects occurred in the animals with imod therapy .\non the other hand , animals in group iii ( immune - chemotherapy ) showed better clinical conditions and significant decreasing in spleen size ( p=0.046 ) comparing with group ii ( chemotherapy ) .   although , the number of animals in each group was not large enough to ensure a statistical analysis due to many problems associated with experimental studies , this was a considerable result .\nthese results suggest that imod can be an important adjuvant for anti - cl therapeutic protocol that causes resolving in clinical staging .\ntherefore , the institution of an immune - chemotherapeutic protocol constituted of imod with glucantime may help to open new windows for treatment of leishmaniasis , consequently decreasing the clinical manifestation .\nthis is a very interesting possibility that needs further investigation for both leishmaniasis and the other immune mediated diseases . in conclusion ,\nthese experimental data suggest that administration of imod in combination with conventional treatment reduce the developing of clinical signs in shorter period and improved the quality of patients life . but the relatively low number of animals in each studied groups , short follow - up period and the possible presence of other differences such as individual characteristics make these data insufficient to draw any conclusion regarding the curative effect of imod in this disease . for confirmation of these data , more clinical and/or experimental studies and extending follow - up period after treatment with using real - time pcr ( 43 , 46 , 47 ) are recommended ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " toxicity and drug resistance against pentavalent antimonials , medications of choice in treatment of leishmaniasis for more than 5 decades , have become important subjects globally.this study was a randomized , open labeled trial that was designed to determine efficacy and safety of imod as a novel herbal immunomodulator drug for treatment of canine visceral leishmaniasis ( cvl).twenty healthy mongrel dogs were infected with iranian strain of l. infantum amastigotes and randomly divided to 5 groups with four animals for each included on : i : negative control ( non -

invasive approach fails , surgical therapy may be the next approach , with duodenojejunostomy being the currently preferred treatment . in this paper , we describe a case of sma syndrome in a young female with characteristic symptoms of duodenal obstruction , whose diagnosis was delayed for 2 years . that led to multiple office and emergency room visits , along with poor quality of life until the diagnosis was made and surgical treatment performed .\nwe present this case to heighten the awareness of this syndrome and the need for early management to prevent diagnosis delay and serious complications .\na 17-year -

sma angle ranges from 38 to 65 , due to the erect posture , while in quadrupeds , it is nearly a right angle .\nthe main anatomic feature of sma syndrome is a narrowing of the aorta - sma angle to < 25 , and as a result , the aortomesenteric distance decreases to < 10 mm , from normally 10 to 28 mm .\netiological factors can be either a congenital or an acquired anatomic abnormality or , more commonly , a debilitating condition causing severe weight loss .\ncongenital etiologies include abnormally low insertion of the sma or high insertion of the angle of treitz dislocating the duodenum to a cranial position .\nacquired anatomic abnormalities can occur following corrective spinal surgery such as scoliosis surgery by a relative lengthening of the spine , spinal trauma , and after abdominal surgery such as total proctocolectomy and ileal j - pouch anal anastomosis due to tension and caudal pull of the small bowel mesentery .\nsevere weight loss , as in our patient , leading to a depletion of the fatty cushion around the sma is a major cause of sma syndrome .\ncatabolic states like burns , eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa , or wasting conditions such as neoplastic diseases and malabsorptive states are the most commonly reported reasons of drastic weight loss .\npatients with sma syndrome may present acutely , with chronic insidious symptomatology , or with an acute exacerbation of chronic symptoms .\nchronic cases like our patient may present with long -

terminal \n tyrosine , because des - tyrosyl fragments show very low binding affinity \n at opioid receptors . in vivo ,\ndyn a is \n degraded rapidly upon release to the des - tyrosyl analogue by aminopeptidases \n in the synapse to terminate dyn a s agonist action at the opioid \n receptors .\ndyn a inhibits smooth muscle \n contractility , which is characteristic of opioid agonists and is blocked \n by naloxone .\nit is also well documented that dyn a and its des - tyrosyl \n analogues can produce motor impairment , paralysis , and enhanced sensitivity \n to sensory stimuli .\nthese effects are not blocked by naloxone , and thus are nonopioid \n in nature .\nit has been proposed that after nerve injury , up - regulated \n dyn \n a in the spinal cord may interact directly with spinal bradykinin \n receptors ( brs ) to promote neuropathic pain .\nconsidering \n the lack of structural similarity between dyn a and the endogenous \n ligands for the brs , bradykinin ( bk ) and kallidin ( kd ) , this interaction \n between dyn a and br could not be predicted but allowed us to identify \n a putative direct neuroexcitatory target .\nhere , we test the therapeutic \n potential of a pharmacological intervention of dyn a at spinal brs \n in chronic pain states by developing br antagonists based on the prototypic \n structures of dyn a.\nthe key step in the rational design \n of br antagonists is to identify \n the pharmacophore of dyn a that directly interacts with the brs as \n an agonist and then to refine the structure for the binding site by \n examining the effects of different substituents to obtain an antagonist .\nfirst , each amino acid at the c - terminal or n - terminal position of dyn a-(213 ) \n ( 10 ) , which has been reported to have neuroexcitatory \n nonopioid effects through brs in the spinal cord , was truncated in sequence and the resulting \n fragments were tested for their binding to brs against [ h][des - arg , leu]-kallidin ( [ h]dalkd ) \n or [ h]bk in rat brain membranes . as a result , a key pharmacophore \n of dyn a for the brs was identified as well as distinct sar ( table 1 ) .\ndyn a-(411 ) ( 7 ) , which has \n the same range of binding affinity ( ic50 = 140 nm ) as 10 ( ic50 = 170 nm ) , was identified as a good pharmacophore \n for the brs .\nalso , the sar results revealed that the br recognition \n predominantly depends on the basicity of the c - terminal \n amino acid residue .\nthe dyn a fragments 4 , 6 , and 13 , which have a c - terminal \n basic amino acid such as lys or arg , showed higher binding affinities \n than those fragments ( 3 , 5 , and 9 ) with a c - terminal hydrophobic amino acid such \n as ile , pro , or leu . for example , dyn a-(513 ) ( 13 ) showed moderate affinity ( ic50 = 470 nm ) at the receptor , \n and after truncation of a lys residue at the c - terminus \n its affinity was reduced 15-fold ( 9 , ic50 = \n 7100 nm ) .\nhowever , subsequent truncation of a leu residue at the c - terminus recovered or even increased its binding to the \n receptor ( 8 , ic50 = 280 nm ) .\nthis distinct \n sar at the c - terminus was maintained during the successive \n truncations of c - terminal residues , and this result \n confirmed the important role of a positive charge for the c - terminal amino acid residues in receptor recognition . on the other hand ,\nconsecutive truncations of the n - terminal amino acid residues to position 4 did not affect their \n affinities to the receptor .\nthe truncation of two amino acid residues , \n gly and phe , in 6 and 10 resulted in negligible \n reduction of the affinities to the receptor .\nthese results suggest \n that the n - terminal part of the dyn a is remote and \n thus not involved in binding to the brs .\nthis is an important feature \n of sar to understand how dyn a analogues recognize the receptor .\nthe \n positive charge of the c - terminal basic amino acid residue may be \n mainly involved in electrostatic interactions with the receptor .\nfurther sar studies on the minimum pharmacophore 7 were \n performed to distinguish the receptor interaction and to increase \n the potency and in vivo stability .\nalthough two arg residues at positions \n 6 and 7 have been known to be important for the biological activity \n of dyn a , on the basis of our primary sar results \n and the amphipathic properties of dyn a structure , it did not seem \n to be necessary to retain two arg residues for binding to brs . therefore , \n the arg residue at position 7 was deleted , and interestingly the resulting \n ligand 14 retained high binding affinity ( ic50 = 190 nm ) to the brs .\nthe removal of the arg residue at position \n 7 did not affect binding affinity at all .\nthis is remarkable because \n in general , deleting one amino acid in the middle of a bioactive sequence \n typically causes significant topographical changes and a different \n biological profile . as discussed earlier\n, the c - terminal basic amino \n acid residue plays an important role in br recognition .\nif the receptor \n recognition is mainly through electrostatic interactions with positive \n charges of the side chain group of a basic amino acid residue , the \n amidation of a c - terminal acid group can be a useful \n modification to increase in vivo stability in the same range of binding \n affinity .\nfor this purpose , the c - terminal acid was \n amidated in 15 , but the modified ligand had greatly reduced \n binding affinity ( ic50 = 6500 nm ) .\nall other amidated ligands \n ( see supporting information ) exhibited \n very low binding affinities in the micromolar range , and this confirms \n the role of a c - terminal acid in the recognition \n of the br .\nlogarithmic values determined from \n the nonlinear regression analysis of data collected from at least \n two independent experiments in duplicate . 10 : log [ ic50 ] = 7.29 \n  0.21 , ic50 = 51 nm . 14 : log [ ic50 ] = 6.85  0.04 , ic50 = 140 nm\nbk : log [ ic50 ] = 7.81 \n  0.17 , ic50 = 15 nm at ph 6.8 in competition assays \n using [ h]bk , and transfected hek 293 cells expressing \n the human b2r .\nin contrast , \n modifications of the n - terminal part \n had little effect on binding affinities .\nacetylation of n - amino group in ligand 16 ( ic50 = 120 nm ) , 20 ( ic50 = 140 nm ) and 23 ( ic50 = 140 nm ) retained good binding affinities \n in the same range as nonacetylated analogues .\neven the inversion of \n chirality of the phe residue from l to d did not reduce their binding \n affinities at the br in 18 ( ic50 = 360 nm ) , 21 ( ic50 = 150 nm ) , and 24 ( ic50 = 200 nm ) .\non the other hand , the same modification at the c - terminus by d - lys decreased its binding more \n than 10-fold in 17 ( ic50 = 630 nm ) .\nhowever , \n thanks to the same basic property , the substitution of a lys residue \n at the c - terminus with an arg in ligands 1924 was tolerated well to maintain the same high \n binding affinities as 14 , even with various modifications \n of the n - terminal position . in order to identify \n the role of hydrophobic amino acids neighboring \n arg residues ,\nthe leu and ile residues were replaced by an ala residue , \n and the resulting ligand 25 had decreased binding affinity \n ( ic50 = 450 nm ) . even with the slight loss of affinity , \n this result suggests that hydrophobicity and size of the hydrophobic \n amino acid residues play a role in isolating basic amino acid residues . \n\nwhen the two ala residues in 25 were replaced by two \n nle , respectively , the modification recovered binding affinity ( 22 , ic50 = 140 nm ) to the same range as 19 .\nfurther acetylation did not change the binding affinity in ligands 23 ( ic50 = 140 nm ) and 24 ( ic50 = 200 nm ) .\nthese results clarify sar at the n - terminal part , where neither acetylation nor d - amino acid \n replacement affects binding affinities of 14 , 16 , and 18 .\ninterestingly , \n the binding affinity of bk in the rat brain membrane using [ h]bk ( ic50 = 91 nm ; log [ ic50 ] = 7.04 \n  0.11 ) or [ h]dalkd ( ic50 = 120 nm ; log \n [ ic50 ] = 6.93  0.08 ) is lower than that ( nanomolar \n range ) reported previously for the b2r , which is the predominant br \n type constitutively expressed in all tissues . on the other hand , dalkd , which \n has been defined as a bradykinin type 1 receptor ( b1r ) selective antagonist , \n binds to the brs ( ic50 = 130 nm ; log [ ic50 ] \n = 6.90  0.07 and ic50 = 76 nm ; log [ ic50 ] = 7.12  0.11 vs , [ h]bk and [ h]dalkd , respectively ) in rat brain membranes in the same \n range as bk .\nthe b2r selective antagonist , \n hoe140 , had very low affinity ( ic50 > 10  000 \n nm ) \n against [ h]bk binding in rat brain membranes .\nthese results \n from rat brain br binding sites differ significantly from that using \n guinea pig ileum ( gpi ) where both bk and hoe140 had high affinity \n ( ic50 = 3.5 nm and 0.43 nm , respectively ) similar to that \n previously reported .\nthus , in the rat central nervous system , we may be targeting a neuronal \n br that is pharmacologically distinct from that previously defined \n in non - neuronal tissues .\nfurthermore , this neuronal br exhibits affinity \n for dyn a in the nanomolar range . for comparison , selected dyn \n\na ligands that showed good affinities at rat brain brs were tested \n for their binding affinities in transfected human embryonic kidney \n ( hek ) 293 cells expressing the human b2r or b1r . ligands 10 ( ic50 = 51 nm ) , 14 ( ic50 = 140 \n nm ) , and other ligands ( see supporting information ) exhibited a similar range of binding affinities for the hekb2r \n as for the rat brain brs ( table 1 ) .\nhowever , \n none of the dyn a ligands showed affinities at the hekb1r where their \n affinities are > 10000 nm .\nas discussed earlier , the most important \n sar result was that removal of the arg residue at position 7 did not \n affect binding affinities .\ntherefore , for the comparison of topographical \n structures of [ des - arg]-dyn a and dyn a , ligands 7 , dyn a-(411 ) , and 14 , [ des - arg]-dyn a-(411 ) , were selected and tested for their \n conformations in membrane - like sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) micelles \n by h 2d - nmr spectroscopy .\nas g - protein coupled receptors ( gpcrs ) such as brs have their binding \n sites close to the lipophilic transmembrane ( tm ) domains , their ligand \ntherefore , for further insight into biological profiles it is crucial \n to identify the membrane - bound structures of the ligands in these \n circumstances . in nuclear overhauser effect ( noe )\nsummary ( figure 2 ) , both ligands showed strong consecutive dn(i , i + 1 ) with a \n break at the pro residue due to the imide nature of the residue ; i.e. , \n the pro residue lacks an amide proton .\nsimilarly they also displayed \n sequential dn(i , i + 1 ) noes throughout the sequence .\napart from trivial noes , consecutive \n dnn(i , i + 1 ) noes and \n a number of medium range dn(i , i + 2 ) noes in the middle segment were observed .\nit is noteworthy \n to observe consecutive medium range noes for shorter linear peptides \n such as ligands 7 and 14 .\nthese observations \n along with no -helical signature noes such as dn(i , i + 3 ) , dn(i , i + 4 ) strongly suggest both \n ligands fold into consecutive turns or a 310-type helical \n fold .\nthe observation of similar noe patterns in both ligands indicates \n that the removal of an arg residue does not significantly affect the \n overall conformation of these ligands in a membrane environment .\nthe thickness of the line corresponds approximately \n to the intensity of noe cross peaks .\nchemical shift deviation of observed ch values from the \n random coil values ( csi plot ) .\nch chemical shifts are very sensitive \n to conformational \n structures , and their consecutive negative and positive deviations \n from random coil values indicate a helical fold and -sheet \n structures , respectively .\nchemical shift \n index ( csi ) plots ( figure 3 ) for both ligands 7 and 14 displayed a similar trend .\nalthough \n it is difficult to conclude simply on the basis of the csi plot since 7 and 14 are very short peptides , the negative \n deviations from the random coil suggest a conformational space in \n the helical domain for both ligands\nsimulated annealing \n molecular dynamics calculations were carried out in order to obtain \n three - dimensional structures .\nnmr - derived distance and dihedral angle \n constraints were applied in the calculations as described in the supporting information .\nthe stereochemical quality \n for the final minimized structures was verified by the distribution \n of per - residue backbone dihedral angles ( phi and psi ) in the ramachandran \n plot .\nthe distribution of phi and psi angles for 14 is \n concentrated in only one region for all residues except the c - terminal lys residue , suggesting that the conformational \n ensemble contains a single family of structures with conformational \n flexibility at the c - terminus around the lys residue \n ( figure 4 ) .\na closer examination of dihedral \n values and their distribution in the ramachandran plot identifies \n two consecutive type iii -turns ( or a short 310-helix : \n type iii -turns and 310-helix have the same dihedral \n angle values ) at the n - terminus , and a distorted \n type 1 -turn at c - terminal region centered \n at pro - lys in 7 .\nhowever , the \n removal of an arg residue in 14 resulted in a single \n type iii -turn at the n - terminus and the same \n distorted type i -turn at the c - terminus . \n\nthe consecutive turn structure at the n - terminus \n in 7 may not be necessary for the b2r interactions considering \n the same range of binding affinities of 7 and 14 .\nramachandran plots of each amino acid for all the final hundred \n structures of 7 revealed semi rigid conformations for \n all the residues except for the arg , or arg and lys residues where \n the psi angle deviation is greater than 30 degrees from the average \n value .\nwe suggest that the flexibility of the three basic amino acids \n in 14 could contribute to the receptor recognition by \n adapting the same conformation as 7 .\nthe nmr study \n showed that the two ligands , 7 and 14 , have \n the same distorted type 1 -turn structure \n at the c - terminus , which is considered a key region \n for binding .\nthis explains how the two ligands bind to the receptor \n with the same affinity even with a dissimilarity of structure at the n - terminus .\nas mentioned above , the n - terminal \n part does not play an important role in the receptor interactions \n and thus does not affect ligand binding . also one arg residue at position \n 3 of ligand 14 seems to be sufficient for receptor recognition \n similar to the two arg residues in ligand 7 . in figure 3 ,\nthe arg residue at positions 5 or 6 showed high positive deviations , which indicate the formation \n of -sheet structures .\nwhen one more arg residue was inserted \n between positions 6 and 7 in ligand 7 , the resulting \n ligand 26 retained nearly the same binding affinity ( ic50 = 110 nm ) at the receptor as 7 and 14 . lowest energy structure and overlay of 10 low energy structures \n of 7 ( lower ) and 14 ( upper ) from the simulated \n annealing molecular dynamics calculations\nrmsd between structures is 2.013  ( 1.694  \n for 14 ) when all the atoms are considered but is reduced \n significantly to 0.502  ( 0.155  for 7 ) when \n only backbone atoms are considered .\nit has been previously \n shown that the optimal binding conditions for the br to its endogenous \n ligands , including bk , is at ph 6.8 .\nthus , \n we also tested the effect of ph 6.8 on the ability of dyn a analogues \n to bind to the br in rat brain membranes ( table 2 , figure 5 ) .\nthese initial analyses found \n that the affinity for all 4 analogues selected was enhanced by 2 to \n 8 fold .\nadditional analyses shown in table 3 demonstrate that other analogues also interact with the rat brain \n br with affinities in the nanomolar range .\nthese data validate the \n optimal binding conditions for the dyn a analogues to be at ph 6.8 , \n which is consistent with the binding conditions previously established \n for brs .\ndata for each nonlinear \n regression analysis were collected from at least two independent experiments .\ndetails described \n in table 1 . on the \n basis of the binding affinities of the three ligands 7 , 14 , and 26 ,\nit was considered that two \n neighboring basic amino acid residues are not necessary for br recognition , \n and furthermore it was observed that in relatively longer length analogues \n such as ligand 27 , truncation of the arg residue increased \n their binding affinities ( log [ ic50 ] = 7.17  \n 0.10 , ic50 = 68 nm at ph 7.4 , cf .\nit is clear that the ligand consists of basic amino acids and hydrophobic \n amino acids possessing amphipathic properties and a pro residue making \n a turn structure .\nthis is similar to other ligands that show good \n binding affinities to the br .\nsuccessive truncations of n - terminus and substitutions of a basic amino acid residue and hydrophobic \n amino acid residue with a lys and nle did not change their affinities . \n analyzing the structure of all the ligands that showed good binding \n affinities at the brs\nprovides the following insight regarding the \n pharmacophore of dyn a analogues for the rat br in the cns : it requires \n a basic amino acid residue such as a lys and arg at the c - terminus , combinations of basic amino acid residues and hydrophobic \n amino acid residues , and a pro residue as a hydrophobic residue to \n make a turn structure .\non the basis of the sar results , the pharmacophore \n for the br can be simplified as an amphipathic structure as shown \n below in figure 6 .\nligand 32 , \n which retained high binding affinity ( ic50 = 58 nm ) after \n successive truncation at the n - terminus , is considered \n as a minimum pharmacophore to fulfill the structural requirement ( l = 0 , m = 2 , one pro ) .\ntogether , it suggests \n that the br recognition depends on the electrostatic interactions \n between positive charges of the ligand and negative charges of the \n br , and thus to amplify the electrostatic interactions , the positive \n charges of the ligand should be allocated by making a proper topographical \n structure\n. this may be the role of hydrophobic amino acid residues \n including the pro .\npharmacophore of dyn a for brs . as shown \n in figure 6 , the pharmacophore of dyn a for \n brs represents a simple amphipathic structure .\nin order to ensure \n the specificity of the dyn a analogues for the br , lead ligands 14 and 32 were screened at 43 off - target receptors . \n\nwhile the screen was limited , the blinded analysis supports the notion \n that the ligands interaction with br is specific ( see supporting information ) .\nwe also tested selected \n dyn a analogues for their binding to the three cloned opioid receptors \n ( [ h]damgo , ( [ h]deltorphin , and [ h]u69,593 for the rat mu opioid receptor ( rmor ) , human delta opioid \n receptor ( hdor ) , and human kappa opioid receptor ( hkor ) , respectively ) . \n\nno ligand showed affinities for the  and  opioid receptors \n but ligands 1013 , which include \n a longer n - terminus part , exhibited low affinities \n ( 10 , ki = 560 nm ; 11 , ki = 2400 nm ; 13 , ki = 2200 nm ) at the  opioid receptor \n ( n = 2 ) .\nhowever , our lead ligands , 14 and 32 , did not exhibit affinity at the  opioid \n receptor ( ki > 10  000 nm , n = 2 ) .\nthe effect of test drug on production \n of [ h]inositol phosphates was expressed as a ratio of \n stimulated over basal activity defined as the amount detected in the \n absence of test drug .\nto determine the functional activity \n of ligand 14 , \n we tested its ability to stimulate the hydrolysis of [ h]inositol phosphates in transfected hek 293 cells expressing the \n human b2r .\nthis bioassay measures the production of the intracellular \n second messenger , inositol triphosphate , which has been defined as \n the primary signal produced upon the activation of b2r by bk . in the hekb2r cells ( figure 7 ) ,\nbk stimulated the production of [ h]inositol \n phosphates with an ec50 of 3.9  2.4 nm .\nligand 14 , in contrast , showed no stimulation up to a dose of 10 \n m .\nalso , there was no overt cell death observed in ligand 14 up to 10 m .\nthe nontoxic \n effect of ligand 14 was also demonstrated by in vivo \n rotarod and hindlimb tests using nave rats ( figure 8) . in the rotarod test , intrathecal ( i.th . )\nadministrations \n ( 3 nmol ) of 14 retained the similar latencies as vehicle \n and 10 . in the hindlimb test , i.th .\nadministration of 14 did not show any motor impairments at a high dose ( 30 nmol ) , \n but 10 ( 25 nmol , i.th ) induced paralysis that occurred \n within a few minutes postinjection and lasted for 30 to 40 min . in \n addition , pretreatment of 14 ( 30 nmol , i.th . )\ncompletely \n blocked ligand 10 ( 25 nmol , i.th.)-induced paralysis , \n suggesting that ligand 14 may inhibit dyn a s \n excitatory effects in vivo .\neffects of ligand 10 or / and 14 on thermal \n hyperalgesia ( left , radiant heat test ) and tactile hypersensitivity \n ( right , von frey test ) 2 h after i.th .\nstatistical significance was determined by \n 95% confidence interval ( * p < 0.05 , * * p < 0.01 , * * * p < 0.001 vs vehicle ; n  6 ) . to evaluate the hyperalgesic effects of 10 and 14 , radiant heat and von frey filaments tests were performed \n in nave rats ( figure 9 ) .\npaw withdrawal \n latencies and thresholds of all animals were 18.7  0.6 s and \n 15  0 g , respectively .\nadministration ( 3 \n nmol/5 l ) of ligand 10 reduced these values to \n 11.4  1.0 s and 7.3  1.0 g in 1 h , demonstrating thermal \n hyperalgesia ( paw withdrawal latency : area under curve ( auc )  \n sem = 2067  137 in 2 h ) and mechanical hypersensitivity ( paw \n withdrawal threshold : auc  sem = 1074  68 in 2 h ) . in \n contrast , administration of 14 increased latency of paw \n withdrawal from a heat source when compared with vehicle control , \n an effect that is defined as analgesic ( figure 9 , left panel ) .\ncoadministration of 10 and 14 prevented the hyperlalgegia induced \n by 10 when given alone .\nthese data suggest that ligand 14 can effectively block ligand 10 , to induce \n abnormal pain states in vivo , presumably mediated by spinal brs as \n an antagonist .\nthermal and tactile hypersensitivities were also \n assessed in rats \n that had received unilateral l5/l6 spinal nerve \n ligation ( snl ) injury ( figure 10 ) . before injury , \n\npaw withdrawal latencies and thresholds of all animals were between \n 19.320.9 s and 15 g , respectively .\nsnl injury reduced these \n values to 8.611.3 s and 2.22.9 g , respectively , indicating \n abnormal sensitivities to thermal and tactile stimuli in the injured \n hind paw .\ninjured animals treated with ligand 14 showed \n antihyperalgesic effects in both tests in a dose dependent manner \n in 2 h. the greatest antihyperalgesic effects occurred at the highest \n dose of 3 nmol/10 l in both tests .\nthe ability of 14 to reverse abnormal pain states \n in this model of neuropathy underscores the potential role of spinal \n brs as a therapeutic target for neuropathic pain .\ntogether \n with our previous studies characterizing the role of spinal dyn a \n in neuropathic pain , the results of the present study not only support \n a structural basis for dyn a s actions at the spinal brs to \n promote pain , but also show that it is possible to develop antagonists \n like 14 that target cns brs for therapy .\ndose - dependent reversal \n of thermal hyperalgesia ( left , radiant \n heat test ) and tactile hypersensitivity ( right , von frey test ) using \n varying doses of 14 ( i.th . ) in l5/l6 snl - operated male sd rats .\nstatistical significance was determined \n by 95% confidence interval ( * p < 0.05 , * * p < 0.01 vs vehicle ; n  6 )\n. local administration of 14 had no effect on bk -

home assessment .\nanother advantage of swimming , from a recent study using a mouse model , is increased muscle mass , function and metabolic profile . based on the present results\n, it can be concluded that swimming 2 to 3 times per week for 8 weeks continuously can improve the rom of the hip joint by about 5% , not only in oa dogs but also in normal dogs as well .\na human study found that aquatic exercise for 6 weeks can improve the rom of the hip joint by 10.9% .\na study comparing the therapeutic benefits of treadmill walking and swimming found that dogs that swam had significantly greater stifle rom compared with dogs that exercised by walking on a treadmill .\nmoreover , we used radiographic images to compare the pathology of oa joints between pre- and postexercise .\nradiographic findings between weeks 0 and 8 in the oa - sw group showed no significant change .\nhowever , radiographic images can not provide as much information as an mri or ct , but we did not have these facilities for animal use at our institute .\nwhen the levels of serum biomarkers were compared between the oa and non - oa groups , a significantly lower level of serum ha and a higher level of serum cs - wf6 were found in oa dogs compared with non - oa dogs .\nthis result was similar to our previous study on dogs with hip dysplasia , which showed that the serum levels of cs - wf6 increased , while ha levels decreased . taken together with other reports [ 4 , 21 ] , this demonstrates the usefulness of these biomarkers to predict the progress of oa .\nan increase in the wf6 epitope may reflect a catabolic response , while a decrease may reflect a blockage of the catabolic pathways ; this may be helpful for the diagnosis or prognosis of disease .\nthe ha concentration in the joint fluid and serum of animals with diseased joints has been reported to be lower than normal because of a decrease in the synthesis mechanism via synoviocytes and chondrocytes [ 23 , 32 ] .\nhip joints are diarthrodial joints , which are freely moveable joints containing synovial fluid within a connective tissue joint capsule that allows for low - friction and low - wear articulation of the cartilaginous ends of long bones .\njoint movement is very important for homeostasis in the joint environment because it helps articular cartilage absorb synovial fluid . in oa animals ,\njoint movement is restricted because of pain , which in turn decreases the absorption of synovial fluid by articular cartilage .\nthis will lead to decreased nutrients and an accumulation of waste products in cartilage . shortly after exercise ,\nan elevation of serum levels of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein ( comp ) was found in patients with oa , suggesting an effect on cartilage metabolism .\na recent study found an exercise - induced increase in interleukin-10 levels in the ( peri-)synovial fluid of patients with knee oa , to which anti - inflammatory and chondroprotective properties are ascribed .\na novel monoclonal antibody , wf6 , which recognizes an epitope in native cs chains , was decreased after swimming .\nthe finding of decreased levels of serum cs - wf6 after exercise reflects an alteration in the metabolism of the cartilage . in chronic oa , the level of cs - wf6 is higher than normal because the native cs chain in cartilage is degraded and released into the blood stream [ 23 , 24 ] .\nthe decrease of cs - wf6 in this study indicated that swimming could increase the anabolism and decrease the catabolism in oa joints .\nit is also possible that swimming could increase the blood supply to the joint , thus increasing the metabolism in cartilage and surrounding tissue .\nthis is supported by the serum ha results in the present study ; ha levels increased in both swimming groups , but to a greater extent in oa dogs than in normal dogs .\nalthough ha is widely distributed throughout the body ( umbilical cord , nasal cartilage , vitreum , cutis , and lymph nodes in the thorax ) , the highest concentration is found in synovial fluid and also in connective tissue such as the synovial membrane .\nour results found that , after 8 weeks of a swimming regimen , the rate of ha synthesis was higher in oa dogs than in normal dogs .\nit is possible that swimming induced ha synthesis by synoviocytes and chondrocytes from increased blood supply to the joint . in human studies , blood flow during maximal exercise\ncompared to resting conditions has been found to increase up to 20-fold on average , and in predominantly white muscles increases up to 80-fold have been reported .\none disadvantage of this study was that we could not measure biomarker levels in synovial fluid during swimming , which could provide useful information for further research , for example , on the levels of other serum biomarkers or gene expression . in conclusion\n, the present study demonstrates that it is possible to evaluate the effects of exercise on articular cartilage .\nwe discovered a significant change in serum biomarker levels in the group that performed swimming compared to the nonswimming group .\nswimming appears to be a useful strategy for regaining movement and function in with oa joint ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " this study aimed to determine whether swimming could improve function of osteoarthritic joints in canine hip oa . \n fifty -

stevenson 2005 ) .\nalthough it is generally agreed that estrogen plays a role in skeletal homeostasis the precise mechanism by which it exerts its sparing effect on bone is still not fully understood . to this end a concerted global effort has ensued to identify how estrogen contributes to bone metabolism and to ascertain if the effects of this steroid hormone are direct or otherwise . for a considerable time\nthe effects of estrogen on bone were thought to be indirect since receptors for estrogen had not been isolated from bone tissue .\nthe identification of estrogen receptors in human primary osteoblasts and osteoblast - like osteosarcoma cells twenty years ago provided the first indications that a direct effect of estrogen upon bone tissue might be involved ( eriksen et al 1988 ; komm et al 1988 ) .\ngideon rodan ( 1991 ) proposed that estrogen might exert an anabolic action in bone either directly or via the generation of local growth factors .\nearly evidence in support of an anabolic action of estrogen in bone came from studies using rat osteoblasts ( ernst et al 1989 ; gray 1989 ) in which type i collagen mrna expression increased in response to estrogen .\nhowever estrogen administration to rats does not stimulate bone formation ( westerlind et al 1993 ) . also ,\nresearch conducted in rigg s group found no direct effect of estrogen on human osteoblast growth and maturation ( keeting et al 1991 ) .\nsimilarly estrogen was without effect on type i collagen protein synthesis in human fetal ( robinson et al 1997 ) and adult ( mahonen et al 1998 ) osteoblasts .\nalthough attractive , the possibility that estrogen might elicit a direct anabolic action in mammalian bone is certainly not compelling ; estrogen actually inhibits pre - osteoblast proliferation and decreases osteoblast activity ( turner et al 1994 ) and only modest increases in bone mass have been obtained for mice treated with suprapharmacological doses of the steroid ( samuels et al 1999 ) .\nfurthermore a dose of 1500 g estrogen / kg murine body weight was unable to induce endocortical bone formation ( bain et al 1993 ) . given that 5 g estrogen / kg is sufficient to saturate the estrogen receptor ligand - binding sites it is highly unlikely that the effect of estrogen on any bone formation is via a  conventional pathway  ( turner 1999 ) .\nturner comments that the increased bone mass ( more specifically , osteosclerosis ) reported by samuels and colleagues ( 1999 ) is attributed to bone marrow toxicity due to the very high circulating estrogen titre . suffice it to say estrogen does not appear to be a particularly potent factor in the regulation of bone mass ; mice nullizygous for either estrogen receptor alpha or beta have normal bone mass , furthermore only modest osteopenia is observed in mice lacking both receptors ( lindberg et al 2001 ; mccauley et al 2002 ; windahl et al 2002 ) .\none other possible influence of estrogen on the skeleton is to inhibit the process of bone resorption by osteoclasts . with over half a century of basic and clinical research conducted after albright and colleagues made the important connection between estrogen deficiency and op , pacifici ( 1998 , 2008 ) distilled the biological basis of postmenopausal op down to increased bone - resorbing cytokine production .\nthe miscreants responsible are chiefly interleukin-1 ( il-1 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf- ) and their significance to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal op will become clearer in due course .\nmost recently nakamura and colleagues ( 2007 ) have provided evidence that estrogen withdrawal may prolong the life span of osteoclasts which in turn might be to the detriment of bone during periods of prolonged estrogen deficiency . in light of the proven efficacy of hrt in preserving bone mass postmenopause\nit is likely that estrogen dampens the process of bone resorption rather than promoting matrix synthesis .\nmenopausal endocrinology is not a simple case of estrogen decline . at the time of albright s publication in 1941 ,\nalthough extragonadal factors ( primarily from the pituitary ) were believed to influence gonadal function herbert mclean evans and colleagues only coined the terms follicle - stimulating hormone ( fsh ) and luteinizing hormone ( lh ) four years prior to albright s publication ( medvei 1982 ) .\nindeed the dynamic link between estrogen and gonadotropins even escaped pincus and kirsch in 1965 ( medvei 1982 ) .\nit is widely recognized that even modest estrogen withdrawal culminates in a corresponding rise in both lh and fsh from the anterior pituitary .\nit is particularly noteworthy why investigations into lh / fsh on bone metabolism have not , until quite recently , been considered despite the inverse and inextricable link between circulating estrogen and lh / fsh .\nit is a genuine possibility that raised gonadotropin levels might participate in bone resorption and contribute to the pathogenesis of postmenopausal op .\na description of how they came to be identified in the context of bone biology and how they might impact upon the skeleton are presented below .\nthe biochemical composition and metabolism of bone collagen in op formed the phd thesis of the author .\npart of the phd studies involved the application of the ovariectomized ( ovx ) rat model , a widely used and accepted experimental tool to study bone in response to estrogen withdrawal ( saville 1969 ; mcosker and li 1991 ; wronski and yen 1991 ) .\nin addition to the ovx model , i was keen to explore alternatives to ovx , primarily from a welfare point of view .\none particularly attractive alternative to ovx was the application of a depot formulation of the luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone ( lhrh ) agonist goserelin ( zoladex ) that had been shown to last at least one month ( ward et al 1989 ) . although the lhrh agonist buserelin had been used previously in rats ( goulding and gold 1989 ) , this required daily injections and therefore constant animal handling , which was something i wanted to avoid .\ntotal hydroxyproline ( hypro ) excretion relative to creatinine clearance was used to monitor collagen catabolism in the ovx and lhrh models on a weekly basis . as expected hypro excretion rose markedly within the first week of ovx and remained elevated for up to 3 weeks after which it steadily fell to control levels by the sixth week . in marked contrast zoladex administration\na second depot likewise resulted in a significant reduction in hypro excretion , the levels once again rising to controls by week 8 .\na clear polarization in hypro excretion was evident ; ovx was producing the expected rise in collagen catabolism whereas estrogen deficiency triggered by zoladex was actually decreasing it .\nalthough the use of zoladex was employed as an alternative to ovx for the induction of estrogen deficiency , it was particularly interesting to note a very different response of the model to agonist treatment in terms of bone catabolism .\nthe degree of osteopenia elicited by ovx and buserelin treatment was similar  and that  administration of buserelin provides a new way of inducing estrogen - deficiency osteopenia in the rat without removing the ovaries  .\nfor example all the urine hypro analyses for the agonist - treated rats gave lower values than the ovx group .\nin addition for half of the time points the urine hypro concentration between controls and agonist treated animals were similar .\nwhat is also important to note is that although goulding and gold pitched their article advocating buserelin as a surrogate for ovx the authors postulate that the differences identified for the two models may account for some steroidal protection in agonist treated rats .\nit is also possible that what goulding and gold had actually found was evidence of gonadotropins contributing to bone turnover but had overlooked their potential significance .\nsimilarly tobias and colleagues ( 1994 ) noted key differences between ovx and buserelin treatment on indices of trabecular bone turnover in rats ; whereas 90 days post ovx produced up to 80% tibial cancellous bone loss , buserelin resulted in approximately 40% loss .\nin addition parameters reflecting changes in bone formation rate differed for the two models since buserelin treatment was not accompanied by increases in bone formation .\nlike goulding and gold , tobias and colleagues suggested that the tool itself was to blame rather than providing a suggestion that gonadotropins in some way might be accountable . importantly yeh and colleagues ( 1996 ) subsequently revealed that an intact pituitary was necessary to trigger bone loss in response to estrogen withdrawal ; whereas ovx resulted in marked bone loss , hypophysectomy in combination with ovx attenuated the osteopenic response . in light of the data that i had observed between zoladex and ovx , i stated in my doctoral thesis that  these observations may support an important function for the gonadotropins in modulating the process of bone resorption .\n these data have since been published ( mansell et al 2007 ) , but for a few years after obtaining my phd , bone biologists were reluctant to believe that gonadotropins had any role to play in skeletal metabolism following reports that lhrh agonists could cause osteopenia .\nto further investigate the potential role of gonadotropins in skeletal development and morphology static histomorphometry and bone mineral density ( bmd ) were determined in mice nullizygous for the lh receptor ( lurko ) or mice overexpressing hcg .\nboth groups exhibited skeletal phenotypes ; male lurko mice had reduced bone mass for both femur and tibia whereas female hcg overexpressing mice had greatly elevated bmd at these sites . with regards to the latter model the circulating estrogen concentration was approximately double that of the wild type mice and would not have been sufficient to cause the large increase ( 30% ) in murine bmd given that only suprapharmacological levels of this steroid yield less than comparable bmd in mice ( samuels et al 1999 ) .\nimportantly the increase in bmd reported for female hcg overexpressing mice could be prevented by ovx , thereby supporting a role of the ovary in generating the skeletal phenotype of these mice .\none possible explanation however might be raised testosterone from hcg receptive thecal cells ( kumar 2005 ) .\nalthough the level of testosterone in the hcg overexpressing mice was elevated ( 6-fold ) the potential for this steroid to explain the bone phenotype requires corroboration . as stated above , the research gleaned from the application of lhrh agonists to treat prostate cancer and endometriosis has raised concerns regarding their impact on the skeleton .\nimportantly the research gathered from the use of these agonists indicates that gonadotropins do not participate in bone tissue metabolism .\nhowever , the magnitude of bone loss appears to be small and  unlikely to be of any clinical relevance  ( fogelman 1992 ) .\nalthough there are studies identifying bone loss in response to lhrh agonist use there are also reports in which the risk of developing op is no different to age - atched individuals in the community ( eg , peters et al 2001 ) . given that fsh / lh are greatly elevated at menopausal onset and that lhrh agonist administration does not mirror the skeletal changes observed for ovx it is possible that gonadotropins in some way contribute to bone catabolism .\na stark characteristic of the ovx rat / mouse is obesity ; despite pair feeding with sham - operated controls , ovx animals always gain weight because of increases in intraabdominal fat .\nthe increased fat and its distribution following ovx is likely linked to a cushingoid state attributed to elevated glucocorticoids . since the discovery of lh receptors in the adrenal gland and adrenal hyperfunction post ovx and the menopause ( kero et al 2000 ; carlson 2007 ) , it is tempting to hypothesize that raised lh post - ovx might drive bone catabolism via increased cortisol production .\nexcessive cortisol , as found for patients with cushing s syndrome , increases the risk of developing op because glucocorticoids diminish bone - forming osteoblast numbers ( manolagas 2000 ; mancini et al 2004 ) .\nthe perimenopausal period is associated with the most rapid phase of bone loss ( randolph et al 2004 ; sowers et al 2006 ) even in the face of higher - than - premenopausal estrogen levels but very high circulating fsh ( prior 1998 ) .\ndevleta and colleagues ( 2004 ) have recently provided a compelling association between raised fsh and osteopenia in ammenorrheic women . similarly kawai and colleagues ( 2004 )\ncollectively these findings inspired the mount sinai bone program to investigate whether bone could be a target for fsh .\na combination of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( rt - pcr ) , flow cytometry , western blotting , and immunocytochemistry revealed that human and murine osteoclasts , and their precursors , expressed fsh receptors ( fshr ) .\nosteoclastogenesis occurred when both human and murine bone marrow precursors were co - treated with fsh and receptor activator for nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b)-ligand ( rank - l ) , a factor central for osteoclast formation .\nfurthermore fsh stimulated bone resorption and triggered phosphorylation of erk , akt , and i-b , effectors of the proresorptive actions of rank - l .\nthere are now good data supporting the expression of gi2-coupled fshr on osteoclasts and their precursors ( sun et al 2006 ) . in vivo , mice haploinsufficient for fsh\nsevere estrogen deficiency occurs in response to fsh or fshr ablation yet mice nullizygous for either have preserved bone mass despite being estrogen - deficient .\nthese striking findings indicate that fsh directly participates in the regulation of bone mass ( sun et al 2006 ; zaidi et al 2007 ) .\nrecall that a major local stimulus for driving bone resorption postmenopause is tnf- and there are compelling studies putting tnf- as a key mediator of bone loss in response to estrogen withdrawal ( pacifici 1998 , 2008 ) ; mice nullizygous for tnf- do not lose bone in response to ovx ( roggia et al 2001 ) and insensitivity to tnf- protects against estrogen deficient osteopaenia ( ammann et al 1997 ; kimble et al 1997 ; charatcharoenwitthaya et al 2007 ) .\nit is now known that this cytokine is mobilized by bone marrow precursors in response to fsh ( iqbal et al 2006 ) .\nlow - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 5 ( lrp5 ) is a co - receptor for wnt/catenin signalling ( he et al 2004 ) .\nit is now known that lrp5 is required for osteoblast proliferation ( gong et al 2001 ; kato et al 2002 ) and possibly the prevention of osteoblast apoptosis ( babij et al 2003 ) . in a recent review of the literature ( mizuguchi et al 2004 ) it is becoming clear that lrp5/wnt signaling is central for postnatal bone development and adult bone accrual making lrp5 an exciting candidate for further study in the context of musculoskeletal diseases , including osteoporosis and osteoarthritis .\nloss - of - function mutations in lrp5 result in osteoporosis - pseudoglioma syndrome ( oppg ) , an autosomal recessive disorder ( gong et al 2001 ) .\nconversely a gain - in - function mutation , for example a g171v point mutation , results in elevated bone mass , enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity and raised active osteoblast number ( babij et al 2003 ) .\nfurthermore mutation analysis of families and patients has revealed at least 19 lrp5 sequence variants of which 6 are thought to result in a high bone mass phenotype ( van wesenbeeck et al 2003 ) .\nit has recently been reported that lrp5 is associated with circulating fsh in normal postmenopausal women ( zofkova et al 2007 ) .\na compelling association between serum fsh levels and a c / t ( c.4037:a1330v ) polymorphism in the lrp5 gene was identified whereas no relationship was found for lh , estrogen testosterone or their precursors .\nthe link between fsh and lrp5 strengthens the postulation that lrp5 is implicated in the changes accompanying the menopause .\nin addition their relationship supports the concept of co - evolutionary mechanisms linking calcium homeostasis with reproductive biology .\ngiven the compelling association between the regulation of bone mass with lrp5 and the association between this co - receptor and circulating fsh , the dynamic relationship between lrp5 and fsh certainly warrants closer investigation into bone metabolism postmenopause .\nthe revelation made by sun and colleagues ( 2006 ) that fsh is the chief miscreant for postmenopausal op has sparked considerable debate amongst leading researchers in the field ( baron 2006 ; martin and gaddy 2006 ; seibel et al 2006 ; prior 2007 ) ; seibel and colleagues ( 2006 ) postulate that the osteopaenic resistance in fshr/ fsh nullizygous mice is attributed to raised testosterone in the face of elevated lh .\nfurthermore there are no reports of lower rates of bone loss for individuals with pituitary insufficiency compared to those with raised gonadotropins in response to natural or surgical menopause . in this regard seibel and\ncolleagues suggest that differences in the levels of sex steroids explain the skeletal phenotype reported by sun and colleagues ( 2006 ) .\nhowever it is important to recognize those clinical and natural endocrine events in which the estrogen - deficiency - osteoporosis model does not hold ; importantly the rate of bone loss is greater during the perimenopause than during the first years postmenopause when estrogen levels are lower .\nwhilst jerilynn prior ( 2007 ) acknowledges that the estrogen - deficiency - osteoporosis model  faces considerable challenge  all are in agreement that much more research into the potential role of gonadotropins in skeletal physiology will have to be undertaken to displace it .\nalthough we are far from a paradigm shift it is highly likely that our understanding of the skeletal response to estrogen deficiency will widen and with it changes in our approach to treating and preventing postmenopausal op ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " scant attention has been paid to the potential role of gonadotropins in bone tissue homeostasis . \n the focus on estrogen and estrogen replacement therapy for osteoporosis as far back as the 1940 s may account for the paucity of gonadotropin studies in bone biology . \n it is conceivable that prevailing dogma may have subconsciously steered us away from addressing whether gonadotropins have a place in skeletal physiology . \n however an examination of bone tissue catabolism in ovariectomized ( ovx ) and luteinizing hormone - releasing hormone ( lhrh ) agonist ( zoladex)-treated rats generated some interesting and conflicting data ; zoladex - treated rats , unlike the ovx group , failed to exhibit increased bone collagen catabolism despite clear evidence for estrogen deficiency . \n the findings , although controversial , supported the possibility that elevated gonadotropins in the ovx model were in some way accountable for increased bone catabolism . in response to these initial findings \n further studies were performed to determine if altered lh status may in some way impact on the skeleton to this end an investigation of bone mass and histomorphometry were conducted in lh receptor nullizygous mice and human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) overexpressing mice . \n there were clear phenotypic differences ; the lh receptor knockout mice displayed reduced bone mass whereas the hcg overexpressing animals had stark increases in bone mass . \n much more recently the team of the mount sinai bone program have made a significant discovery that bone - resorbing osteoclasts express receptors for follicle - stimulating hormone ( fsh ) and that mice nullizygous for fsh receptor are resistant to bone loss despite severe estrogen deficiency . \n details of these fascinating models will be presented together with additional findings that give credence for exploring gonadotropin action on the skeleton as we enter the twilight of this decade of the bone and joint .

like receptors ( tlrs ) and tumor necrosis factor receptors ( tnfrs ) [ 14 , 16 , 17 ] .\nso far , many animal models of chronic colitis and colitis - associated cancer ( cac ) provide evidence that a variety of inflammatory mediators play pivotal and specific roles in the initiation and development of colitis and cac .\nin particular , tnf and tnfr ligation activated nf-b and its downstream cell survival pathways seem to highly contribute to the development of colorectal carcinoma .\nil-6 is another important cytokine which controls the transition between innate and acquired immune responses , and increased levels of il-6 have been detected both in human colon cancer patients and murine models of cac .\nin addition , mrna expression of cc - chemokines including ccl-2 ( mcp-1 ) is highly upregulated in the colonic mucosa of ibd patients as well as in the aom pretreated dss - colitis model [ 2224 ] .\nour group recently identified that one of the mammalian chitinases , chitinase 3-like-1 ( chi3l1/ykl-40 ) , is significantly upregulated in message and protein levels in the colonic mucosa of ibd patients with active inflammation as well as murine models of colitis ,   and this molecule seems to play an active role in the neoplastic transformation of epithelial cells [ 25 , 26 ] .\ntherefore , inflammatory cell infiltration and their secreting soluble mediators are key players in regulating pre - neoplastic growth of cecs in colitis - associated tumorigenesis . in this paper , we have concisely summarized the previously reported animal models of cac and will discuss possible roles of inflammatory mediators and their receptors in the chronically inflamed colonic mucosa during the development of chronic inflammation and cac .\nsporadic colorectal cancer , the major form of colon cancer , occurs in people with little or no family history of the disease .\nthis type of cancer often arises from successive accumulation of mutations in genes controlling epithelial cell growth and differentiation .\ngenomic instability is important to the development of colon cancer ; however , the process that causes this genomic instability is not completely understood .\ntwo major types of genomic instability , chromosomal instability and microsatellite instability ( msi ) , contribute to colonic carcinogenic processes .\nmsi - positive colorectal carcinomas can be further divided into those with high ( msi - h ) or low ( msh - l ) levels of msi depending on how many markers are unstable on a consensus panel .\nhigh - level msi accounts for approximately 15% of sporadic colorectal cancers , while the remaining 85% are attributed to chromosomal instability .\nmsi - h colorectal cancers neither exhibit gross cytogenetic abnormalities nor display allelic losses at tumor suppressor loci frequently , and they are not generally aneuploid .\nthese tumors are likely to be present in the proximal colon , demonstrate poor differentiation , have mucinous or medullary features , and display more prominent lymphocytic infiltration compared to microsatellite stable tumors or msi - l tumors . \n\t\t\t\t\nthis is characterized by widespread imbalances in chromosome number ( aneuploidy ) , caused by defects in chromosomal segregation .\nmutations in specific tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that activate pathways critical for cancer development , which are important for the initiation and progression through the cell cycle , are seen in colorectal cancer [ 30 , 31 ] .\nthe mitotic checkpoint ( the spindle assembly checkpoint ) is a major cell - cycle control mechanism that ensures proper chromosome segregation by delaying anaphase progression until all pairs of chromosomes are properly aligned on the metaphase plate .\ndefects in checkpoint signaling lead to chromosome missegregation and subsequent aneuploidy with abnormal numbers of chromosomes being distributed to daughter cells .\nthe products of two genes , mitotic arrest - deficient ( mad ) and budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles ( bub ) , operate as checkpoint sensors and signal transducers that control sister chromatid separation .\nthe activation of these leads to inhibition of the anaphase - promoting complex ( apc / c ) , a large ubiquitin - protein ligase , and cell - cycle arrest .\nmad3/bubr1 , mad2 , and bub3 associate with apc / c - activating molecule cdc20 to form the mitotic checkpoint complex and induce a conformational change in apc / c , which prevents binding and ubiquitination of its substrates .\nthe apc / c activation leads to degradation of securin ( a protein involved in control of the metaphase - anaphase transition and anaphase onset ) and activation of separases ( a class of caspase - related proteases ) .\nseparase regulates a multiprotein complex termed cohesin , which creates physical links between sister chromatids that are maintained until late mitosis . the errors in this system lead to unequal chromosomal segregation .\nin colorectal cancer , mutations have been found in hzw10 , hzwilch / flj10036 , and hrod / kntc , which are kinetochore proteins that function at the spindle checkpoint .\ncentrosomes coordinate mitosis by serving as an anchor for the reorganization of cytoplasmic microtubules into a mitotic spindle apparatus . when extra centrosomes are present , they lead to the formation of multiple spindle poles during mitosis , resulting in an unequal distribution of chromosomes . when centrosomes cluster , an increased rate of merotelic chromosomal attachment to spindle can cause chromosomal missegregation and ultimately chromosomal instability .\na third mechanism is a mutation in aurora b , a kinase regulating chromosome segregation .\nthis is the catalytic component of the chromosomal passenger complex that regulates accurate segregation of chromatids at mitosis , histone modification , and cytokinesis .\nfinally , the elevated expression of pik1 ( a serine / threonine kinase which regulates entry into mitosis , centrosome duplication , and transition from metaphase to anaphase , and cytokines ) is also observed in colorectal cancer [ 38 , 39 ] .\nchronic inflammatory diseases are associated with an increased risk of cancer , and ibd patients have a higher risk of developing cac approximately 810 years after the initial diagnosis as compared to general population .\nin addition to genomic instability that underlies the process of tumorigenesis , continuous inflammation in the intestine seems to be a key factor in cac development since chronic inflammation is associated with elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines , chemokines , growth factors as well as their receptors , and reactive oxygen species . in particular , oxidative injury , causing widespread dna damage , leads to the inception of cancer .\ncrypt fission ( duplication of crypts by branching ) propagates these heterogeneous dna changes from one crypt to another .\nin fact , crypt fission is a natural way to duplicate the heterogeneous changes that are sometimes observed in the crypt units of uc patients .\neventually , some of these changes may induce a growth advantage and clonal expansion of cecs , and some of the mutational changes in one crypt can be found in thousands of adjacent crypts .\nthe final stages of tumorigenesis in the chronic inflammatory setting occur when an accumulation of select mutations allows clonal progression to overtake the balancing forces of cell death and loss .\na summary of cac development in genetically engineered animal models of colitis has been shown in table 1 .\nwe have further discussed some selected models , which are included or not included in table 1 , in this section .\nalthough adenomatous polyposis coli ( apc ) multiple intestinal neoplasia ( min ) mice do not develop adenocarcinoma , these mice develop numerous adenomatous polyps throughout the small and large intestine , and therefore , we have included this model in the following section . \n\t\t\t\t\t\napc is a multidomain protein translated from the apc gene and composed of 2843 amino acids , which functions to regulate downstream wnt signaling by binding to -catenin and promoting its degradation .\napc , along with axin , gsk-3 , eb1 , and other proteins , forms a complex that binds to -catenin .\nthis complex formation prevents the nuclear translocation of -catenin and causes its phosphorylation and , subsequently , its degradation by a proteasome . in this way\n, apc actually acts as a tumor suppressor gene by preventing the continuous activation of -catenin .\na mutation or loss of apc genes results in the upregulation of transcriptional targets such as c - myc and cyclin d1 . loss or mutation of apc is an early causative event in familial and sporadic colon cancer pathogenesis .\nthe most common mutations in familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) are deletions in codons 1309 ( 10% occurrence ) and 1061 ( 5% occurrence ) .\nthe majority of germline mutations found in fap patients are nonsense mutations , which cause the formation of a truncated protein because of the insertion of an early stop codon .\nmost of the mutations to apc represent truncating mutations , of which , 46% are small deletions , 10% are small insertions , 28% are nonsense mutations , and 13% are gross alterations .\nmore than 60% of apc mutations are found in the mutation cluster region ( mcr , amino acids 12841580 ) , the region that is most important for the downregulation of -catenin and for the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer .\nmany of these mutations lead to the generation of a truncated protein , which causes the loss of apc protein function [ 54 , 55 ] .\n. however , those that are heterozygous for the mutation are viable and develop more than fifty adenomas in the intestinal tract .\nthese mice can also develop a variety of lesions in other organs such as desmoids tumors , epidermoid cysts , and mammary tumors .\nmost apc mice only survive to 120 days , at which point they die of the excess tumor formations in their small intestines . in apc mice , different areas of the gene , such as the eb1/rp1 binding area , dlg / ptp - bl binding area , nuclear export / import signals , the cdk consensus phosphorylation site p34-cdc2 binding , the -catenin binding site , -catenin downregulation site , and axin / conductin binding site , are missing by truncational mutations . because apc is an important molecule in the formation of colorectal cancer , mouse models have been developed to study the physiological and biological function of this protein in polyp formation .\napc mice have been widely utilized for studying the effects of this protein under controlled experimental conditions .\napc mice were treated with ethyinitrosourea ( enu ) to induce colitis , and multiple intestinal neoplasia was observed carrying a nonsense mutation [ 56 , 58 ] . \n\t\t\t\t\t\nthe apc mutation initiates mitotic defects in histologically normal crypt cells of the murine small intestine , in which misoriented spindles , misaligned chromosomes , and tetraploid cells are frequently observed .\nin addition , changes in crypt size , cell proliferation , and apoptosis have been observed .\nthe cells in these apc deficient crypts show reduced crypt to villus migration and differentiation .\nchromosomal instability resulting in losses and/or gains of chromosomal regions and microsatellite instability , which results from mismatch repair deficiency , is another change observed in apc deficient mice .\nsecretory phospholipase 2 ( spla2 ) is a key enzyme involved in the release of arachidonic acid from membrane lipids in the synthesis of prostaglandins .\nin addition , pla2g4 ( group 4 cytosolic phospholipase a2 catalyzes the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid ) suppresses tumor multiplicity in apc .\nalthough apc mouse is a good model of colitis , there are differences between the progression of disease in mice and humans . in apc mouse model\n, the polyp formation occurs mainly in the small intestine , while this formation occurs mainly in the colon in humans .\nin addition , there is very little or no invasion of the submucosa by tumors in apc mice , and the tumors do not develop into adenocarcinomas .\nprevious studies have shown that one of the downstream targets of wnt signaling , cyclin d1 , was not upregulated immediately after apc loss and did not contribute to the early phenotype in colon cancer .\nin contrast , the loss of both proto oncogene c - myc and apc has a crucial role in early stages of sporadic colorectal carcinoma development . as argued by some investigators ,\nloss of apc function is typically an early stage event in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal carcinoma , but apc mutation itself seems to be a later stage ( from high - grade dysplasia to adenocarcinoma ) of tumor progression in cac , suggesting apc mutation may not be the universal initiating event in colon cancer .\nhowever , loss and/or truncation of apc still highly contributes to the cause of mitotic spindle defects that , upon somatic inactivation of other chromosomal instability genes ( e.g. , spindle and cell - cycle checkpoint genes , dna repair , and telomerase maintenance ) , underlie aneuploidy as observed in the majority of colorectal cancer .   \npatients with mutated il-10 signaling systems show early and aggressive development of systemic inflammation including ibd .\nthe histopathology of chronic colitis in il-10 ko mice is characterized by epithelial hyperplasia , inflammatory infiltrates in the mucosa and submucosa , and crypt abscesses .\nthe inflammatory infiltrates consist of small to moderate numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils as well as lymphocytes , plasma cells , and macrophages , and may involve the intestine transmurally .\nsix - month - old mice showed other lesions characterized by irregular glands , back - to - back growth of glands , small nests of epithelial cells in the intestinal walls , fibrosis , and slight loss of nuclear polarity consistent with adenocarcinoma .\nalthough the adenocarcinomas in il-10 ko mice are histologically very similar to those seen in ibd patients , the lack of involvement of k - ras , p53 , apc , and msh genes indicates that il-10 ko mice are not optimal for investigating ibd - associated carcinogenesis .\nthe development of cac in il-10 ko mice has been demonstrated in c57bl/6/129-ola mixed background mice .\nthese il-10 ko mice have a 25% incidence of developing adenocarcinoma after 3 months of age .\nsimilarly , it was found in another study that il-10 ko mice develop tumors , the majority of which are invasive adenocarcinomas , between 25 and 35 weeks of age .\nfinally , a third study showed the incidence of adenocarcinomas was 14% at 9 weeks of age and 65% at 1031 weeks of age .\nwhen recombinant il-10 was administered to these mice , the incidence of adenocarcinoma decreased from 67% to 28% .\nin addition , the background of the mice influences the incidence of adenocarcinoma ; il-10 ko balb / c , il-10 ko 129 svev , and il-10 ko c57bl/6 have incidences of 29% , 67% , and 0% , respectively , at 3 months of age .\nil-10 ko mice in 129svev background showed epithelial extension / invasion mainly in the ascending colon and subsequently developed adenocarcinomas at 6 months of age without showing any signs of metastatic disease .\nthe development of adenocarcinoma in il-10 ko mice seems to be associated with colonic bacterial infection .\nil-10 ko mice infected with helicobacter   typhlonius had a 40% incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma , and the pups born to these mothers , as well as mice infected as pups , had an 18% incidence of colon cancer .\nin contrast , mice infected with helicobacter rodentium had a 0% incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma .\ninterestingly , however , pups born to these mothers and mice infected as pups had an incidence of 12% .\nfinally , mice infected with both types of bacteria had a 57% incidence of invasive adenocarcinoma .\nit is hypothesized that the bacteria infect the mice by burrowing through the mucus to grow adjacent to the intestinal epithelial surface , where they degrade the barrier properties .\nthis causes injurious leakage of bacterial antigens into the mucosa , which causes an immune response that in turn leads to the development of ibd and subsequently adenocarcinoma in the host .\naom and dss treatment promotes inflammation - mediated colonic tumor growth in il-10 ko mice .\nfurthermore , helicobacter hepaticus infection accelerates aom - induced tumorigenesis compared to aom treatment alone in il-10 ko mice .\nil-10 ko mice crossed to human muc1-transgenic mice developed much more severe colitis with a significantly higher incidence of colon cancer as compared to il-10 ko mice .\nmuc-1 has been reported to be overexpressed in ibd and adenocarcinoma , while its expression levels in normal and healthy cecs are low .\ninterestingly , vaccination against muc1 delays ibd onset and also prevents cac development in these mice , suggesting that the induction of muc1-specific adaptive immune responses , such as anti - muc1 igg and anti - muc1 ctl , regulate local and systemic immunity by eliminating abnormal muc1-positive cells in the ibd colon . \n\t\t\t\t\t\ng proteins ( guanine nucleotide - binding proteins ) are signal transducing proteins that couple a large family of receptors to effectors such as adenylyl cyclase , phospholipase c , and ion channels .\nreceptor - activated g proteins are subsequently bound to the inner surface of the cell plasma membrane , which consists of the g and g subunits .\nthere are four classes of g subunit , namely , gs , gi , gq/11 , and g12/13 . gi inhibits the production of camp from atp a c - terminal splice variant of i2 , which localizes to the golgi apparatus and could be involved in membrane transport .\nthe inhibition of adenylyl cyclase , stimulation of inwardly rectifying and atp sensitive k+ channels , regulation of fibroblast proliferation , stimulation of map kinase pathway , differentiation of f9 teratocarcinoma cells into primitive endoderm , and regulation of neonatal growth and development are all dependent on this . to further analyze the biological function of g proteins in cellular signaling and cell differentiation , ko mice for gi2 gene\nthese mice developed an ibd with clinical and histological features strikingly similar to uc , including the development of adenocarcinoma of the colon [ 46 , 70 ] .\ngi2 ko mice with colonic ulcerations had foci of regenerative proliferation of glandular epithelium through the full thickness of the mucosa and , in some foci , both the inflammation and glandular epithelium penetrated into the submucosa .\napproximately 30% of mice showed highly atypical glands characterized by back - to - back growth without intervening stroma , loss of nuclear polarity , and marked crowding indicative of colon cancer ; however , polypoid growths were not evident in these mice .\nmigration of circulating leukocytes into the intestinal mucosa was partially dependent on 4 integrins , and short - term administration of anti4 integrin antibodies was effective to attenuate intestinal inflammation in some animal models of colitis and human clinical trials [ 7174 ] .\nhowever , hornquist 's group showed that long - term ( three times / week for 9 weeks ) blockade of 4 integrin significantly increased the severity of colitis as well as cancer incidence and also showed decreased levels of total iga and igg level in the sera of gi2 ko mice .\ntherefore , caution needs to be made upon applying a long - term treatment with anti-4 integrin antibody in clinical trials .\nctt is one of the best primate models for studying colitis and cac although it is not currently used because of the risk of extinction .\nctt was previously an important primate model for the study of colitis and cac because , like humans , it spontaneously develops colitis which often leads to colorectal cancer .\nthe ctt 's natural habitat is a rain forest located in northwestern colombia , south america .\nctt were initially imported to the united states in the 1960s and were used for infectious studies with herpes samirii , herpes ateles , and the epstein - barr virus .\nhowever , all research studies were withdrawn when the ctt were placed on the endangered species list in 1977 . during the reconstruction effort of the ctt breeding colonies , it was found that chronic ulcerative colitis and colonic adenocarcinoma were to be major health problems for this species [ 77 , 78 ] .\napproximately 80% of the captive ctt developed active colitis that would eventually lead to low - to - high grade dysplasia and colonic adenocarcinoma .\nanother group also identified that 65.4% of captive ctt showed severe colitis but none in wild ctt , and 19.5% of captive ctt showed moderate colitis but only 13% in wild ctt . in ctt , species - related susceptibility and infection ( e.g. , corona viruses , campylobacter , helicobacter , and enteropathogenic escherichia coli ) seem to be one of the causes of chronic colitis [ 77 , 80 ] .\nother extrinsic / intrinsic factors include disruption of the immune system , family history of ctt , short - chain fatty acids ( scfas ) , carcinoembryonic antigens ( ceas ) , and environmental stress . a unique member of helicobacter is found in the intestines and feces of ctt with chronic colitis .\nthe pathogenicity remains unknown , but since the helicobacter family is considered to be responsible for inflammation and hyperplasia of epithelial cells and predisposes an individual to neoplasia , it is conceivable that this novel helicobacter may play a role in contributing to uc and cac of ctt .\nwatkins et al . utilized a humanized anti - tnf monoclonal antibody ( cdp571 ) in treatment for the spontaneously developed colitis in ctt , and showed rapid improvement in clinical parameters .\nthis result strongly suggests that tnf overproduction is likely a critical pathogenic factor in spontaneously developed chronic colitis in ctt .\nseveral clinical studies have established that a chimeric ( 75% mouse/25% human ) anti - monoclonal antibody ( infliximab ) is beneficial in the treatment for ibd [ 82 , 83 ] .\nin particular , infliximab is an effective maintenance therapy for fistulizing cd   and is useful for the treatment of mucosal ulceration associated with cd .\nit is also noted that disrupting inflammatory mediators ( neutrophils , lymphocytes , monocytes , eosinophils , and mast cells ) are involved in the development of chronic colitis .\ntwo research groups elegantly demonstrated that administration of monoclonal antibodies directed against either e - selectin or integrin -4 ( one of the subunits of vla4 ) attenuated colitis in ctt [ 73 , 74 ] .\nsince the followup animal studies by other groups also confirmed an important role of -4 integrins in the migration of circulating leukocytes into the intestinal mucosa , a clinical trial using natalizumab ( a humanized anti--4 monoclonal antibody ) for cd was initiated , and showed a statistically significant effect in the initial trial [ 71 , 85 ] .\nin addition , during the treatment with natalizumab , some patients developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy secondary to reactivation of the jc virus , a human polyomavirus that is typically acquired during childhood and remains latent in the kidneys and possibly other sites in up to 80% of the adult population\n. furthermore , blockade of 4 integrin exacerbated the chronic colitis and increased cancer incidence in a gi2 ko mice model .\nbased on these results , efficacy of natalizumab for cd is highly questionable , and it carries a potential risk of severe complications .\nto reproduce the clinical course of uc experienced in humans , which is characterized by the spontaneous onset of active inflammation with separated periods of disease inactivity , dss is administered for 37 days in mice to induce inflammation of the colon , followed by regular water administration for 1 - 2 weeks to permit healing of the colonic mucosa .\ncycles  of dss administration have also been used in order to augment carcinogenesis as observed in chronic ulcerative colitis patients .\nsquamous metaplasias of the rectal mucosa , squamous papilloma , adenoma , and adenocarcinoma have been observed in the treated mice . during the development of dss - induced colorectal tumor , several genes , and molecules\nwe have summarized some of the important factors in the following section as well as in tables 2 and 3 .\nthe apc mutation is found in 80% of sporadic colorectal cancers and is found in 4%27% of cac . to test the effects of this gene on cac development\nthe first cycle of dss administration consisted of 4 days of 4% dss followed by 17 days of regular water .\nthe second cycle consisted of 3 days of 4% dss followed by 18 days of regular water . in another experiment , the mice ( female , b6 background ) were treated with 4 cycles of dss with each cycle consisting of 4 days of 4% dss and 17 days of regular water . through these treatments , a two - fold ( 50% to 100% ) increase in tumor incidence was found .\nthe untreated control apc mice had no evidence of invasive colorectal cancer while 40% of the dss - treated apc mice developed colorectal cancer .\nthe incidence of adenocarcinoma in wt mice exposed to dss was 12.5% and the mean number of tumors per tumor - bearing mouse was 1.0 .\nall the dss - treated wt mice had polypoid tumors with no evidence of flat lesions .\nthese findings indicate that both the mutation of apc and inflammation accelerate the formation of colitis - associated dysplasia and their progression into invasive carcinoma . while inflammation is an augmenting factor for colorectal cancer development , loss of heterozygosity of the apc gene\nthe loss of p53 is one of the early mediators in cac [ 112 , 113 ] . in the studies ,\ndss - colitis was induced in p53+/+ , p53+/ , and p53 ko mice in c57bl/6 background .\nthe mice were treated with 3 to 4 cycles of dss followed by 120 days of regular water treatment after the final cycle of dss administration .\neach cycle consisted of 4 days of 4% dss followed by 17 days of regular water .\nthere were no colorectal lesions in untreated p53+/+ , p53+/ or p53 ko mice , while colorectal cancers developed in 57% of the dss - treated p53 ko mice , 20% of p53+/ , and 20% of p53+/+ .\nthe dss - treated p53 ko mice had a larger number of lesions including cancers and dysplasias per mouse as compared to p53+/ or p53+/+ mice . in the p53 ko group , 38.5% of the mice exhibited flat cancers , 46.1% flat dysplasias , 15.4% polypoid cancer , and 0% polypoid dysplasias .\nin contrast , the dss - treated p53+/ mice showed more polypoid neoplasms : flat cancers were seen in only 16.7% of the mice , flat dysplasias in 0% , polypoid cancers in 5.6% , and polypoid dysplasias in 77.8% .\ntherefore , flat cancers are highly associated with p53-deficient genotype while polypoid dysplasias are associated with p53+/ and p53+/+ genotypes .\nin addition , nuclear translocation and mutation of -catenin were observed only in polypoid lesions ( 91% and 43.7% , resp . ) .\nthis result strongly suggests that the loss of p53 enhanced induction of cac , and particular flat cancer - lesions , and dysregulation of -catenin signaling plays an important role in the formation of polypoid - dysplastic lesions in the p53 model of colitis - associated neoplasia .\nafter treatment with 2 cycles of 4% dss ( 7days dss treatment with 14 days interval ) , neoplastic lesions developed in 100% of p53 ko , 46.2% of p53+/ , and 13.3% of p53+/+ mice .\nfurthermore , the majority of lesions in p53 ko were flat while those seen in p53+/+ mice were polypoid dysplasia .\nhowever , nuclear translocation of -catenin was observed in both flat and polypoid neoplasias . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\ninos activation causes prolonged production of no at the cytotoxic level , and inos is overexpressed in colonic mucosa of uc patients and may contribute to pathogenesis of colitis associated neoplasia [ 116 , 117 ] . in one study , inos ko and inos+/+ mice ( in c57bl/6 background ) were treated with dss ( 1% dss for 15 cycles , which consisted of 7 days dss and 10 days interval with regular water per each cycle ) and were fed with a high - iron diet ain76a .\nboth groups developed well - differentiated adenocarcinomas in the intestine at the similar prevalence at the age of 255 days ( 68.4% in inos ko and 65.2% in inos+/+ mice ) .\nthe tumor multiplicity was also similar between the two groups ( 2.0  0.2 in inos ko and 1.5  0.2 in inos+/+ mice ) .\nthese results show that there is no difference in uc - associated cancer development in inos ko and inos+/+ mice , suggesting that in the absence of inos , the other two isoforms of nos , endothelial nos ( enos ) and neuronal nos ( nnos ) , may take over the role of inos and may play a role in nitrosative stress and uc - associated carcinogenesis in this model .\nmsh2 is one of the mismatch repair genes that is frequently mutated in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer ( hnpcc ) .\nit is unclear whether loss of mismatch repair contributes to development of colitis associated neoplasia in humans [ 119 , 120 ] . in a study ,\ncolitis was induced in msh2 ko , msh2+/ , and msh2+/+ mice on a 12910la x c57bl/6 background using dss treatment .\nthere was no difference in severity of chronic colitis as well as incidence of colonic neoplasms among the different genotypes .\nafter 5 cycles of dss treatment , 12.5% of msh2 ko , 8.0% of msh2+/ , and 46.7% of msh2+/+ mice developed high - grade dysplasia . similarly , colonic adenocarcinoma of the mucinous type were seen in 13.3% of msh2 ko , 8.0% of msh2+/ , and 16.7% of msh2+/+ mice although the majority ( 77.8% ) of the msh2 ko mice tumors were microsatellite instability high opposed to none of the msh2+/ and msh2+/+ mice .\nhowever , future studies using these mice may elucidate the role of the dna mismatch repair in colitis - associated neoplasia in humans .\nbrp39 is a mouse homologue of chitinase 3-like-1 ( chi3l1 , ykl-40 , hc - gp39 ) .\nchi3l1 is induced on cecs and macrophages under inflammatory conditions and plays a key role in host - microbial interactions by enhancing the adhesion and invasion of bacteria into the cecs . to examine the biological function of this molecule in the development of cac\n, our lab has developed an aom - pretreated chronic dss - induced cac model using brp39 ko and brp39+/+ mice .\nbrp39 ko mice were more susceptible to the chronic dss colitis with increased proinflammatory cytokine production and inflammatory cell infiltration in the colonic mucosa as compared to brp39+/+ mice .\nsubsequently , the brp39+/+ mice had a higher incidence of cac ( 87.5% ) than brp39 ko mice ( 37.5% ) , suggesting that brp39 plays a key role in the development of cac .\niron - deficiency anemia is a frequent complication in uc patients due to colorectal bleeding , and these patients are clinically treated with iron supplements .\nreported that dietary iron supplementation enhanced the development of cac in a 1% dss - induced colitis model , and the histology of the tumors was fairly similar to that of human cac . in the chronic dss - treated mice , 88% of iron - enriched diet fed mice developed colorectal tumors while only 19% of the control developed the tumors , suggesting that dietary iron may enhance the development of cac in ibd patients presumably by augmenting oxidative and nitrosative stress [ 96 , 108 ] .\nthere are effective chemical agents , which directly or indirectly , induce colorectal tumors in laboratory animals .\nmany researchers use azoxymethane ( aom , methyl - mrthylimino - oxido - azanium ) , 1,2-dimethylhydrazine ( dmh ) , and/or methyl azoxy methane ( mam ) acetate in the animal models of cac .\ndmh - induced colorectal cancer in rats shows many similarities to human colorectal cancer ; however , there are some differences between the two .\nalthough many human colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps , aom- or dmh - induced rat adenocarcinoma in the colon develop in the background of flat mucosa without polyp formation .\nin addition , it has been reported that the incidence of metastasis is relatively low in aom- or dmh - induced adenocarcinoma , while colorectal cancer patients have an approximate 50% metastatic rate in regional lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis . despite these differences ,\nthe chemical - induced cac models are widely used , and have provided valuable information regarding the pathogenesis of cac .\naom is the oxide of azomethane and is used in cancer research to enhance the formation of colorectal tumors in rodents .\naom augments the expression of cyclooxygenase ( cox)-2 ( but not cox-1 ) in colonic tumors , which , in turn , suppresses transforming growth factor- receptor 2 ( tgfbr2 ) expression in cecs   and activates intrinsic tyrosine kinase of epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr )   in laboratory rodents .\nafter treatment with subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection of aom ( 10  mg / kg body weight , in general ) followed by multiple cycles of dss , the treated mice developed colonic tumors within a relatively short time period [ 101 , 102 ] .\naom / dss - induced colonic dysplasia and adenocarcinoma showed nucleic translocation of -catenin and positive staining for cox-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthesis , but no immunoreactivity to p53 .\naom - treated apc mice have also shown an enhanced expression of cox-2 in the early phase of colitis - associated tumors . interestingly\n, molecular analysis clearly demonstrated that aom exposure induces the mutations in codons 33 and 34 , while dss exposure induces mutation in codon 32 of the mouse -catenin gene . a single dose of various colon carcinogens including aom and dmh , followed by exposure to 2% dss just for one week is effective enough to induce colonic tumors [ 104 , 105 ] , suggesting that there is no correlation between the severity of colitis and development of colonic tumors .\nexposure to bacteria ( by transferring from germfree to a specific pathogen free condition ) followed by repeated aom treatment for six times induces cac in il-10 ko mice , but not in wt mice .\nthe results support the notion that inflammation itself plays an important role in the initiation and progression of cac .\ncarrageenan ( cgn ) are high molecular weight ( > 200  kda ) gelatinous polysaccharides , which are extracted from red seaweeds , and are widely used as thickening and stabilizing agents in the food or other industry products .\nalthough the native form of ogn is thought to be harmless , a degraded form of cgn ( so called poligeenan or dcgn ) with acid treatment at high temperature , around 80c , reduces the molecular weight ( < 50  kda ) and may have toxic effects in animal models including rats , guinea pigs and monkeys by causing colonic ulceration and neoplasia in the gastrointestinal tract .\ncgn - induced squamous metaplasia persisted in almost all experimental rats and progressed irreversibly , and the tumors included adenoma , adenocarcinoma , squamous cell papilloma , and squamous cell carcinoma .\ntobacman 's group demonstrated through in vitro studies that the native form of cgn induces il-8 production in ncm460 human cec line by enhancing the activation of nf-b pathway [ 130 , 131 ] .\nfurthermore , dcgn induces cellular aggregation and enhances icam expression and tnf production in monocytes through nf-b activation both in vivo and in vitro .\nthese studies suggest that both native and degraded cgn may have a pronounced effect on the exertion of an inflammatory pressure on colonic mucosal cells including cecs and monocytes / macrophages .\na complicated immune network is involved in cac development . to understand this mechanism in cac\n, we have summarized the main interacting cells and soluble factors in figure 1 , and major signaling pathways involved in cac development in figures 2 and 3 .\ntnf produces multiple effects including altered cell proliferation and cell death through distinct signaling cascades resulting from binding to tnfr type - i ( tnfr1 ) and type - ii ( tnfr2 ) . in general , cell death ,\naltered target gene transcription , and cytokine production are mediated by tnfr1 , while engagement of tnfr2 has an antiapoptotic effect , acting through an nf-b pathway .\nthese receptor - mediated signalings regulate inflammatory cell infiltration in the lamina propria , epithelial / mucosal damage , and cytokine expression in colonic mucosa in many animal models of colitis and cac .\nin fact , tnfr1 knockout ( ko ) mice showed a much milder form of colitis with a reduced incidence of cac in response to the aom pretreated dss - induced colitis as compared to wt mice .\ntnf initiates and perpetuates many inflammatory reactions and efficiently recruits activated inflammatory cells to the site of injury or inflammation .\ndysregulated tnf production has been identified in a various inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis , ibd , psoriasis , ankylosing spondylitis , and refractory asthma .\ntnf - blocking agents have been widely utilized for treatment of said disorders . in particular , these agents show a significant efficacy in refractory ibd compared to other anti - inflammatory and/or immunosuppressive medications .\netanercept , a recombinant fusion protein consisting of the extracellular ligand - binding region of recombinant human tnfr attached to the constant ( fc ) region of human igg1 , binds to circulating tnf , inhibits its attachment to tnfrs , and efficiently blocks the tnf - mediated inflammatory pathway in rheumatoid arthritis .\nhowever , while it efficiently blocks the tumor formation in aom - induced cac model , the efficacy of etanercept in ibd is quite limited as compared to monoclonal antibodies directed against tnf ( e.g. , infliximab ) .\nin contrast , anti - tnf antibodies show unclear efficacy ( anti- or procarcinogenic effects ) in colorectal cancer development [ 139 , 140 ] . il-6 ( also known as ifn- or b - cell stimulator factor-2 ) plays an important role in the transition from acute inflammation to chronic colitis , as well as innate immunity to acquired immunity .\nil-6 is mainly produced by macrophages after being exposed to specific microbial molecules , so called pathogen associated molecular pattern ( pamps ) .\nil-6 binds to a cell - surface receptor complex , which consists of an il-6r chain ( cd126 ) and the signal - transducing component gp130 ( cd130 ) .\nthe ligand - receptor interactions initiate signal transduction cascades through transcription factors , janus kinases ( jaks ) and signal transducers and activators of transcription ( stats ) .\nin addition , il-6 enhances the differentiation of th17 cells under a combination with immunosuppressive cytokines ( e.g. , tgf ) [ 143 , 144 ] .\nil-6 expression is significantly increased in ibd and in murine models of colitis , and the blocking of il-6 signaling significantly inhibits the severity of colitis in murine models [ 145150 ] .\na randomized pilot study of humanized anti - il6r in active cd patients showed no beneficial effect in improvement with endoscopic and histologic examination , although an 80% improvement of clinical symptoms in patients who were treated with the ab as compared to 31% improvement in placebo patients was noted . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nil-6 production is highly upregulated in colorectal - tumor developing apc mice and animal models of cac [ 152 , 153 ] . in human , increased serum levels of il-6 production have been identified in colorectal cancer patients .\nil-6 expression is mainly regulated by nf-b activation , and il-6 acts on both cecs and immune cells [ 155 , 156 ] .\neffects of il-6 are mediated mainly by transcription factor stat3 activation in cancer cells , and stat3-mediated cell activation further promotes cell - survival and cell - cycle progression of premalignant as well as cancer cells by inducing expression of antiapoptotic genes ( e.g. , bcl2 , bcl - xl ) and proliferation - associated genes ( e.g. , c - myc , cyclin d1 ) [ 157 , 158 ] .\ninterestingly , inhibition of il-6 signaling significantly reduced tumor development in aom - induced cac model , suggesting il-6 trans - signaling plays a pivotal role in the development of colon cancer .\nrecently demonstrated that expression of suppressor cytokine signaling 3 ( socs3 ) , which is the major negative regulator of stat3 , was significantly reduced in patients with uc - accompanied with colon cancer as compared to inactive uc or active uc , who had no colon cancer progression .\ntherefore , il-6 trans - signaling and stat3 activation must be a potential and attractive therapeutic target for cac progression .\nil-23 is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of two subunits , p40 ( which is shared with il-12 ) and p19 ( also called as il-23 subunit ) .\nil-23 binds to a specific receptor , which is formed by il-12rb1 and il-23r . both il23 ( p19/p40 ) and il-12 ( p35/p40 ) can activate the stat4 transcription factor , and subsequently stimulate the production of ifn. in addition , il-23 , tgf and il-6 conjugationally stimulate nave cd4 + t cells to differentiate into th17 cells , which produce the proinflammatory cytokine il-17 .\nil-23 plays an important role in the inflammatory response against infection , and the expression is increased in ibd [ 162 , 163 ] and in colon cancer .\n. showed antitumor activity of il-23 in a murine model of cancer , in which murine colon carcinoma cells retrovirally transduced with mouse il-23 gene were subcutaneously injected .\ninterestingly , il-23 secreted by tumor cells efficiently suppressed the growth of tumor and the survival of mice by enhancing the production of ifn , il-12 , and tnf . il-23 and th17 cytokines act coordinately to maintain the balance between tolerance and immunity in the gastrointestinal tract .\ncox can convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin h2 , the precursor for prostaglandins , which act on a variety of cells and cause multiple actions including , but not limited to , muscular constriction and mediation of inflammation .\nso far , there are three cox isozymes : cox-1 , cox-2 , and cox-3 ( a splice variant of cox-1 ) .\ncox-1 is found in most mammalian cells constitutively , while cox-2 is undetectable in most normal cells but becomes abundant in macrophages and other cells under inflammatory conditions . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nit has been reported that cox-2 is upregulated in various malignant cells and has a key     role in inflammation - associated carcinogenesis .\noshima et al . first demonstrated the role of cox-2 in colorectal tumorigenesis in mice carrying a mutant apc gene encoding a product truncated at a 716 ( apc 716 ) , a mouse model of human familial adenomatous polyposis .\nanother report also has suggested that intestinal epithelial cells upregulated cox-2 expression in a tlr-4 and myd88-dependent fashion .\nthis signaling is required for optimal proliferation and protection against apoptosis in the injured intestine , while tlr4 may lower the threshold for carcinogenesis in an aom / dss - induced cancer model . in the same model , endogenous administration of pge2 treatment increased mucosal expression of cox-2 , thus pge2 involves in the tlr-4-mediated intestinal tumorigenesis .\nnonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) are widely utilized inhibitors for both of cox-1 and cox-2 enzymes .\nnsaids that selectively block the cox-2 enzyme but not cox-1 are called cox-2 inhibitors that have less adverse effects .\nselective cox-2 inhibitors significantly reduced the number and size of intestinal polyps in apc 716 mice [ 167 , 170 ] and the occurrence of neoplasia in p53-deficient mice treated with dss .\ncelecoxib , another cox-2 inhibitor , prevents a wide variety of cancers including animal models of urinary bladder cancers , human breast cancer cells , human colon cancer cells , and human lung cancer , while clinical trials participants taking celecoxib had a significant increase in their blood pressure , which may have affected their heart disease risk [ 176 , 177 ] . besides the nsaids , salicylates , such as aspirin ( acetylsalicylic acid ) , methyl salicylate and sodium salicylate ,\nare widely used as drugs for their analgesic , anti - inflammatory , and antipyretic effects .\nsalicylates , including aspirin , inhibit prostaglandin synthesis , and aspirin is able to irreversibly inactivate both cox-1 and cox-2 .\nmore recently , it has been reported that regular intake of aspirin has been associated with a decreased incidence of colon cancer .\nsome double - blind randomized placebo - controlled clinical trials indicate that daily consumption of aspirin ( 7580  mg ) can lead to a 40%50% decrease in the risk of developing colon cancer [ 179 , 180 ] .\nthe aspirin - mediated antitumor effect is also supported by animal models , including 1,2-dimethylhydrazine - induced colon cancer model in sprague - dawley rats , aom - induced colon carcinogenesis in f344 rats , and intestinal adenomas model in apc mice .\nin addition , antineoplastic effect can be achieved by eating salicylic acid - rich foods ( e.g. , a wide range of fruit , vegetables , herbs , and spices ) at concentrations as low as 100  nm / ml .\nil-10 ( also known as human cytokine synthesis inhibitory factor : csif ) is a key anti - inflammatory cytokine produced primarily by monocytes , t cells and b cells .\nil-10 can block nf-b activity , and also regulates the jak - stat signaling pathway .\nil-10 interacts with il-10 receptor  subunit ( il-10ra ) and inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines such as il-6 [ 18 , 186 ] .\nil-10 ko mice develop spontaneous colitis , which is similar to human ibd , in particular cd .\nthese mice also develop colitis - associated cancer , which is associated with the overproduction of th1 cytokine .\naom and dss treatment promotes inflammation - mediated colonic tumor growth in il-10 ko mice .\nfurthermore , helicobacter hepaticus infection promotes aom - induced tumorigenesis as compared to aom treatment alone in il-10 ko mice .\nwe have summarized chronic colitis and cac development in il-10 ko in sections 2 and 3 in this review .\ntgf- has an antiproliferative effect in normal epithelial cells as well as early stage of oncogenesis .\ntgf has three protein precursors , the so - called tgf-1 , -2 , and -3 , and each have an n - terminal short ( 2030 amino acids ) signal peptide .\nthe c - terminal region becomes the mature tgf- protein , which makes a homodimer to produce an active molecule .\nthere are three tgf- receptors : types i and ii have a high affinity for tgf-1 , and type iii has a high affinity for both tgf-1 , and -2 . in most of cases\ntgf- can induce foxp3 in human cd4 + cd25 + t cells and regulate the development of cd25 + regulatory t cells . in normal cells , tgf- blocks cell cycles at the g1 stage and stops proliferation and differentiation of cells and promotes apoptosis .\nhowever , once an epithelial cell has been transformed into an adenocarcinoma , parts of tgf- signaling are mutated , and subsequently tgf- promotes tumor growth , migration , invasion , and metastasis at an advanced stage of cac .\nrecently , becker 's group elegantly demonstrated that tgf- receptor ii - deficient mice developed an increased number of tumors as compared to wt mice .\nin contrast , tgf- transgenic mice showed significantly less number of tumors as compared to wt .\nthe authors concluded that tgf- signaling in infiltrating t cells suppresses colon cancer progression by inhibiting il-6 trans - signaling in tumor cells .\noverall , tgf- seems to have a protective effect on chronic colitis and cac development , at least in early stages . \n\ninsulin - like growth factor ( igf)igfs are polypeptides , which show a high sequential homology to insulin .\nigfs generate a complex system with two ligands ( igf-1 and igf-2 ) , two receptors ( igf1r and igf2r ) , a family of six igf - binding proteins ( igfbp 16 ) , and associated igfbp degrading enzymes [ 194 , 195 ] .\nigf1r activation leads to autophosphorylation of receptor and activation of signaling cascades including the grb2/ras / erk and irs-1/pi3k / akt pathways . of note\n, igf-2 is overexpressed in many solid tumors including colon cancer , and also loss of imprinting ( loi ) , an epigenetic alteration , of igf-2 gene ( igf2 ) was discovered in many types of cancer including ovarian , lung , liver , and colon .\napproximately 10% of the population shows loi of igf2 , and it seems to be associated with a personal and/or familial history of colorectal neoplasia since the variant showed a 5-fold increased frequency of colon cancer [ 199 , 200 ] .\nreported that loi and apc double heterozygous mice have an enhanced sensitivity to igf-2 signaling , and aom -

tyrosine activity of egfr [ 204206 ] . on the basis of several clinical trials\nan approximate 80% remission rate has been demonstrated in left sided uc patients with daily egf enemas for 2 weeks as compared to 8% in placebo group ( p < .001 ) .\nrabamipide , an amino acid analogue of 2-(1h)-quinolinone , efficiently upregulates egf and egfr expression .\na significant improvement was observed in the clinical and endoscopic findings with twice daily rabamipide enemas , which were given to patients with uc proctitis for one month .\nthere is a big concern , however , that systemic use of egf might have potent mitogenic effect by increasing tumor development and/or progression in apc min mice .\negfr signaling seems to be required for early stages of colonic carcinogenesis by upregulating cyclin d1 and cox-2 expressions in microadenomas in aom -

treated mice or rats .\nother reports utilizing animal models also support findings of calcium 's ability to inhibit colorectal cancer development [ 215 , 216 ] . according to a report of the american cancer society 's cancer prevention study ii nutrition cohort , which recruited more than 120,000 examinees\n, men and women who had the highest intakes ( approximately 1200  mg per day ) of calcium showed a modestly reduced risk of colorectal cancer compared with those who had the lowest intakes of calcium .\nmany other studies also report that individuals who had a modest to high calcium intake reduced their risk of cancer [ 218220 ] .\nthe exact mechanistic of action of calcium is still unclear , but it binds to bile acids and fatty acids in the gastrointestinal tract to form insoluble complexes ( calcium soaps ) .\nin addition , calcium may suppress cell proliferation in the lining of the colon or cause proliferating colon cells to undergo differentiation .\nchemokines are small chemotactic cytokines , and classified as 4 different types : cc- , cxc- , c- , and cx3c - chemokines .\nchemokines bind to chemokine receptors , which are g protein - coupled receptors , and they are divided into four families : cxcr ( bind cxc chemokines ) , ccr ( bind cc chemokines ) , cx3cr1 ( binds to cx3c ) , and xcr1 ( binds to xc chemokines ) .\nsome chemokines have proinflammatory effects and efficiently promote migration of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells to the site of infection or inflammation .\nin contrast , other chemokines keep tissue homeostasis during the normal process of tissue development .\ntnf induces expression of several chemokines in colonic mucosal cells during the development of ibd .\ntir8 ( also called as sigirr , a member of il-1/tlr family ) deficient mice cause severe colitis with cancer formation after aom / dss - induced colitis , and these mice showed significantly increased production of kc / cxc , mcp-1/ccl2 , and mip1/ccl3 chemokines by tumor cells .\nin particular , cxc and mcp-1 chemokines are known for their effects in enhancing angiogenesis in colon cancer [ 225 , 226 ] .\nalso reported that mcp-1/ccl2 is a crucial mediator of colon cancer development since ccr2 ( a specific receptor for mcp-1/ccl2 ) ko mice showed a milder form of colitis with less macrophage infiltration and a lower incidence of tumors with attenuated cox-2 expression in the aom challenged model . in contrast , mcp-1/ccl2-antagonist - treated mice showed reduced tumor incidence and size in the same animal model .\nthese results strongly suggest that mcp-1/ccl2 may be a potential target in the treatment of colorectal carcinoma associated with chronic inflammation .\nfurthermore , d6 ( a promiscuous decoy and receptor that scavenges inflammatory cc chemokines ) plays a nonredundant role in suppressing inflammatory immune responses in various organs including lungs and skin .\nd6 ko mice were more susceptible to chemically induced colitis , as compared to wt mice , and failed to recover from the colitis .\nthey also exhibited a higher level of proinflammatory cytokine productions and increased number of tumor development in the distal part of colon . in summary , cc - chemokines and their receptors are novel players in tumor promotion and progression during the course of chronic colitis .\nchitin , a polymer of -1,4-n - acetyl - glucosamine , is produced by various living organisms including insects , fungi , crustaceans , and many other organisms except mammals .\nchitin can be degraded by chitinases ( ec 3.2.1.14 ) that belong to members of the glycohydrolase family 18 , in which bacterial as well as plant chitinases are included .\nchitinases have been generally considered to lack in mammalian bodies due to the absence of chitin .\nhowever , recent studies have identified many chitinases including chi3l1 , acidic mammalian chitinase , chitotriosidase , and ym-1   in mammals , and the expression of these chitinases is highly upregulated during the development of chronic inflammation conditions .\nserum levels of chi3l1 are significantly elevated in patients with ibd   as well as those with colorectal cancer , and the expression is positively associated with bad prognosis of these patients [ 236 , 237 ] .\nchi3l1 plays an important role in protecting cancer cells from undergoing apoptosis and also effects cellular invasion by strongly binding with heparin , collagens , and hyaluronic acid , all of these are important constituents of extracellular matrix [ 238 , 239 ] .\nrecently , it has been reported that normal human bronchial epithelial cells express chi3l1 under mechanical stress , which is driven by an egfr and extracellular signal - regulated kinases ( erk)-1/2 signaling pathways .\nthis result strongly suggests that direct activation of egfr with erk family ligands such as egf and heparin - binding ( hb ) egf induces chi3l1 expression in epithelial cells .\ntherefore , growth - stimulating effects of epithelial chi3l1 in response to inflammatory or stressful stimuli seems to be a critical and physiological function in remodeling and maintaining the basic architecture of epithelium ; however , overproduction of chi3l1 from the epithelium must be a cue for further prolonged inflammation and for developing inflammation - associated carcinogenesis , ironically . currently , exact biological function of chi3l1 as well as other chitinases in cac is still largely unknown .\nfurther studies will help clarify the critical role of mammalian chitinases in chronic inflammation and the following carcinogenic change in epithelial cells , which will provide a rationale for the development of novel and new type of immunotherapy for improving the lives of patients with inflammation - associated carcinogenesis .\nit has been strongly anticipated to improve the clinical course of ibd patients not only by creating new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches but also by preventing inflammation - associated cancer formation .\ncurrently , a variety of genetically engineered or chemically induced animal models of cac are available and are very useful for further analysis of the exact mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cac . through the animal models\n, we have learned that a limited number of inflammatory cytokines , chemokines , and growth factors play crucial roles in cac development .\nthus , effective and targeted anti - inflammatory therapies without adverse effects are warranted in order to prevent the development of cac in ibd patients , and the animal models would help us with the invention of anti - inflammatory therapies by testing therapeutic strategies and reagents in preclinical settings ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " \n                   inflammatory bowel disease ( ibd ) is a group of chronic inflammatory disorders that affect individuals throughout life .   \n although the etiology and pathogenesis of ibd are largely unknown , studies with animal models of colitis indicate that dysregulation of host / microbial interactions are requisite for the development of ibd .   \n patients with long -

called core promoter that exerts strong promoter activity , containing several binding motifs including sp1 transcription factor . based on this report\n, we investigated whether indeed sp1 is involved in the regulation of car expression in wide range of cell types . here , using various cancer cell lines we demonstrated that sp1 plays an important role in the regulation of car expression .\ncell culture reagents were purchased from gibco brl ( rockville , md , usa ) .\nhct116 ( car - positive colon cancer ) , pc-3 ( car - negative prostate cancer ) , and sw480 ( car - positive colon cancer ) were cultured in rpmi 1640 supplemented with 10% fbs , penicillin ( 100 units / ml ) , and streptomycin ( 100  g / ml ) at 37c in 5% co2 .\n( car -

gal staining solution ( 2  mm mgcl2 , 5  mm potassium ferri / ferro cyanide , 1  mg / ml x - gal , 0.02% np-40 ) in the dark room at 37c for 6 hours .\nwe first examined the promoter activity of car gene with a series of reporter gene constructs ( figure 1(a ) ) containing serially deleted car promoter region , similar to previous report , and we further tested it in several different cancer cell types beyond urogenital cancer cell lines .\nconsistent with previous report , deletion of a common region that comprises the core promoter containing sp1 binding motif ( 503/498 ) severely impaired the car promoter activity in hct116 and hela cell lines ( figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) ) . additionally , mutation of sp1 binding motif within the core promoter was enough to impair the promoter activity in car - positive cell lines , such as hct116 , hela , sw480 , and hepg2 cell line ( figure 1(d ) ) .  \nnext , to examine how important the sp1 transcription factors are involved in the transactivation , we compared the effects of ectopic expressions of sp1 and dominant negative sp1 ( sp1 dn ) on the core promoter activity .\nthe exogenous expression of sp1 increased the activities more than 2-fold , compared with vector - transfected control cells in mcf-7 and pc-3 cell lines ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . on the contrary , the ectopic expression of sp1 dn couldnot\nregulate the activity . however , mithramycin treatment , which is known as blocking transcriptional activity of sp1 family transcription factors through binding to g / c - rich region [ 12 , 13 ] , significantly suppressed the promoter activity in the cells expressed by ectopic sp1 , but not by sp1 dn ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .\nlikeness , the ectopic expression of sp1 enhanced the core promoter activities more than 10-fold , compared with pgl3 control vector in the same cell lines ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) .\nhowever , under the mutation of sp1 binding site in the core promoter , it exerted very low activity despite of ectopically sp1 expression .\nmithramycin treatment also significantly suppressed the core promoter activity ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) , suggesting that sp1 binding inhibition to car promoter has effect on transactivation activity of car gene . to directly demonstrate the involvement of sp1 , we performed emsa and observed complex formation between dna probe and sp1 protein ( lane 2 in figure 3 ) , which was abolished by wild - type cold competitor , but not by mutated one ( lanes 3 and 4 in figure 3 ) .\nadditionally , the complex was supershifted by sp1 antibody ( lane 5 in figure 3 ) .\nmeanwhile , mutant probe did not show any complex formation ( lane 6 in figure 3 ) .\ntreatment with mithramycin ( mtm ) , which is known to inhibit sp1 binding by targeting gc - rich region of dna [ 12 , 14 ] , prevented the complex formation between sp1 and dna probe in a dose - dependent manner ( figure 3(b ) ) . to demonstrate sp1 directly binding to car gene promoter\ntsa treatment capable of inducing car expression increased sp1 binding to car promoter , as reflected on enhanced pcr product in mcf-7 cells ( figure 3(c ) ) . furthermore , under open chromatin structure by tsa , we scrutinized relationship between acetyl - histone h3 and sp1 binding inhibition with car promoter into mcf-7 cells or car - negative cell line .\nas shown in figure 3(d ) , even if enhancing sp1 binding to car promoter , along with acetyl - histone h3 ( lane 4 ) , in the presence of tsa , the association between sp1 and acetyl - histone h3 was disrupted by sp1 binding inhibition , mithramycin a , indicating that sp1 can regulate car gene under open - chromatin structure by tsa , and sp1 can not bind car promoter in the presence of both tsa and sp1 binding inhibitor into car - negative cell , mcf-7 cells . besides , in car - positive cell , hepg2 cell line , in which car expression is basically high , sp1 binding inhibitor itself led to dissociate binding between sp1 and car promoter ( figure 3(e ) ) .\n. based on the observation that mtm could effectively prevent sp1 binding to car promoter , as shown in the previous emsa and chip assay , we examined cellular effect of mtm on car mrna expression . as expected , mtm dose dependently suppressed car mrna expression in a similar pattern to its effect on promoter activity in all cell lines tested ( figure 4 ) . to further substantiate the involvement of sp1 in transcriptional regulation of car gene\n, we identified the effect of mtm under combinational tsa treatment , which is known to induce car expression through epigenetic regulation , such as histone acetylation , in car - negative cells .\nmtm suppressed both the enhanced car promoter activity and car mrna expression , which were induced by tsa treatment , in a dose - dependent manner ( figures 5(a ) , 5(c ) , and 5(d ) ) . furthermore ,\nas shown in figure 5(c ) , chip assay ( figure 3(d ) ) reflected on car mrna expression through the association between sp1 and acetyl - histone h3 , indicating that sp1 can express car mrna under open - chromatin structure by tsa , and sp1 can not regulate car mrna in the presence of both tsa and sp1 binding inhibitor into car - negative cell , mcf-7 cells .\nhowever , the induction effect by tsa was not prominent in hepg2 cell , which might be due to high expressional level at basal state . furthermore , the inhibition effect of mtm was constant to a certain fixed level determined by the concentration of mtm treated , regardless of how much histone acetylation was induced by tsa as shown in hyperacetylated histone 3 ( figure 5(b ) ) , suggesting that sp1 plays critical role in the car regulation , in addition to chromatin remodeling , although which allows free access of many transcription factors .\nectopic expression of wild - type sp1 ( wt - sp1 ) induced car mrna expression in car - negative mcf-7 cells in the presence of tsa ( figure 5(e ) ) but not absence of tsa ( data not shown )\n. meanwhile , ectopic expression of dominant negative sp1 ( dn - sp1 ) suppressed the mrna expression in car - positive hct116 cells ( figure 5(f ) ) , in a dose - dependent manner . eventually , the expression level of car regulated by sp1 may have effect on its function as receptor for adenoviral entry in the cancer cells .\ntherefore , based on data shown previously , we could practically substantiate the importance of sp1 binding through in vivo study , by demonstrating that mtm treatment prevented the enhanced uptake of adenovirus vector containing -gal transgene in mcf-7 cells , which was mediated by tsa - induced car expression ( figure 6 ) .\nconsistent with the previous report [ 1517 ] , tsa treatment by itself made adenoviral infection increase up to 70% into mcf-7 cell line ( figure 6 ) .\nhowever , by mithramycin treatment , the inhibition of sp1 binding at car gene promoter eventually reduced the effect of adenoviral infection into mcf-7 cell line below 20% , indicating that the decline of car expression by sp1 binding inhibition was not enough to infect adenoviral containing transgene .\ntherefore , we could further confirm that sp1 was essential for enhancing the mrna level of car gene to carry out function as adenovirus receptor in cancer cell .\ncar has recently attracted much attention as being regarded as tumor suppressor in addition to as a primary receptor of adenoviral vector used for cancer gene therapy .\nnonetheless , little is known about the regulation mechanism of car expression . through this study\n, we could be able to further substantiate hdac inhibitor - induced car expression , which comprises sp1 activation for its binding to open chromatin structure , and also we could directly demonstrate the involvement of sp1 transcription factor by emsa , mithramycin treatment , and chip assay .\neventually , we could further clarify the underlying mechanism of hdac inhibitors by demonstrating that the sp1 plays a critical role in the regulation of car expression .\ntranscription factor sp1 plays common role in regulating car expression in diverse cancer cells , such as hct116 ( car - positive colon cancer ) , pc-3 ( car - negative prostate cancer ) , sw480 ( car - positive colon cancer ) , hepg2 ( car - positive liver cancer ) , hela cells ( car - positive cervical cancer ) , and mcf-7 cells ( car - negative breast cancer cell line ) . in case of car - positive cancer cell lines ,\n. meanwhile , under open chromatin structure by hdac inhibitor tsa , sp1 also regulated car expression in car - negative cancer cell lines . in view of regulating car expression ,\ntherefore , it would be of interest to study whether hdac inhibitor could make sp1 induce car expression through sp1 acetylation ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " coxsackie and adenovirus receptor ( car ) was first known as a virus receptor . \n recently , it is also known to have tumor suppressive activity such as inhibition of cell proliferation , migration , and invasion . \n it is important to understand how car expression can be regulated in cancers . \n based on an existence of putative sp1 binding site within car promoter , we investigated whether indeed sp1 is involved in the regulation of car expression . \n we observed that deletion or mutation of sp1 binding motif ( 503/498 ) prominently impaired the sp1 binding affinity and activity of car promoter . \n histone deacetylase inhibitor ( tsa ) treatment enhanced recruitment of sp1 to the car promoter in chip assay \n . meanwhile , sp1 binding inhibitor suppressed the recruitment . \n exogenous expression of wild -

releasing hormone ( trh ) tests were executed in all subjects , both in the study group and in controls .\ntsh response to trh was considered normal if the peak tsh level was between 5 and 25  miu / l .\na peak value above 25  miu / l was considered exaggerated , whilst that below 5  miu / l was considered suppressed .\nthe baseline tsh levels were 8.08  1.66  mui / l in the study group and 7.55  0.80  mui / l in controls . at 20  min of the trh test ,\nthe tsh serum concentration was significantly higher in the population of ivf newborns than in naturally conceived controls : 55.57  14.31 \nstudied 106 ivf children aged 4 to 14 yrs and 68 randomly selected non - ivf controls of the same age .\nthe cut - off tsh serum concentration of 5.0  mu / l was a criterion for the second tsh determination and thyroid ultrasound .\npersistent elevations of circulating tsh were observed in seven ivf children and in none of the controls .\nthe higher sh incidence in in vitro fertilization babies than in controls did not depend on birth weight , gestational age , small for gestational age and adequate for gestational age status , breastfeeding duration , gender , current age , bmi -

ab and tg - ab had no significant influence on the lower and upper limit of the reference interval for tsh .\nthe authors concluded that age , bmi - sds , white blood cells count , and gender should be taken into account when diagnosing sh based on serum tsh concentration .\nthe establishment of the upper limit of normal tsh in different age groups poses a challenge .\nfurthermore , there is no consensus about the tsh level at which treatment should be considered . in most of the analyzed publications , serum tsh over 4.2 \nmui / l was used as sh cut - off point [ 811 , 13 , 14 , 16 , 1921 , 2330 ] .\nscreening for thyroid disorders has become more common in recent years , thus leading to sh being diagnosed more frequently , especially in younger subjects .\nthe analysis of sh - related symptoms was based on two different types of studies . in the first type\n, sh confirmation was sought as a result of symptoms / clinical presentation [ 1218 , 2630 ] . in the second type ,\nsh was diagnosed incidentally and only then followed by clinical assessment for typical manifestation [ 911 , 1925 ] .\nthe natural history of thyroid function was described in two studies [ 8 , 10 ] .\nthe question arises whether sh actually causes symptoms or whether their presence is a coincidence .\nolder sh patients can present cardiovascular risks , depressed systolic function , and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and may report reduced exercise tolerance .\nthe prevalence of sh in children and adolescents in the analyzed literature was between 2.9% and 14.1% [ 8 , 21 , 25 ] and could be modified by weight . in the obese and overweight population ,\nthe percentage of sh was significantly higher , reaching even more than 30% [ 15 , 16 ] , hyperthyrotropinemia being a consequence rather than the cause of a higher bmi .\nstudies analyzing height , growth velocity , and puberty did not confirm a negative influence of sh .\nsh should be distinguished from physiological or transiently increased tsh in the serum , especially during the recovery phase from nonthyroidal illnesses or after subacute , painless thyroiditis .\nthis observation was confirmed by two studies examining the natural course of sh [ 8 , 10 ] .\none of them , a retrospective analysis of 121,052 children , indicated tsh above 7.5  miu / l and female sex as predictive factors for fixed sh .\nspontaneous reversibility of elevated tsh was found in 4173% of subjects [ 8 , 10 ] .\nrarely , higher serum tsh concentrations are seen in patients with tsh - receptor mutations causing mild tsh resistance .\nit can affect up to 0.6% of white population and should be suspected in positive family history of elevated tsh , not coexisting with thyroid autoimmunity .\nhowever , there are a lot of controversies concerning population screening for sh as the benefits of therapy are not proven .\nsingle placebo - controlled studies in older populations confirmed that screening and treatment by l - thyroxine improve the quality of life in only 1% of individuals .\nthe rise in tsh concentration was found incidentally , and only then the symptoms were looked for ; in other cases , nonspecific complaints lead to the assessment of tsh . in both , there is no certainty concerning the connection between higher tsh levels and the presence of symptoms .\nour study limitation is searching in pubmed base only and restricting the search to english language .\nhowever , as the quality of most studies is poor and no definite conclusions can be drawn , randomized , large -

been accorded an essential , even vital place in the education of future chiropractic physicians , physicians , dentists , nurses , administrators , and directors .\nindeed , the collaborative inclusion of the behavioral sciences and other disciplines in the professionalization process of health care workers has been well documented by the former dean of harvard medical school . he asserted that  collaboration . .\ncould be a universal starting point for accelerating our slow march toward global equity in health care .\n an important criterion , therefore , in the teaching of behavioral sciences to health care students for their future professional roles as caregivers is to place the diverse body of descriptive and empirical findings within some type of theoretical framework .\nthis context should incorporate essential concepts and theories from the various disciplines , for example , sociology , psychology , and anthropology , in such a way as to show the interconnectedness of central issues surrounding health care as an institution in societies . indeed ,\nto be ill is not merely a medical problem ; it is also a social event involving more than 1 person and changing the sick person 's customary relationships with others in the family , in the community , and ultimately in society .\nthis article will attempt to present aspects of a conceptual model that can be used as an organizational device for assisting preclinical and clinical chiropractic students to develop a greater comprehension of their future professional roles as health care practitioners in communities and societies nationally and transculturally .\nwe shall present aspects of the society - culture - personality ( scp ) model and the health care institution from the perspectives of ( a ) the socialization or learning process especially as health behavior , illness behavior , and the sick role are all learned behaviors ; and ( b ) the institution of the family as the family is  the unit of medical care because it is the unit of living . \nthe scp model forms an interlocking social system ( fig 1 ) . by definition , a social system is a pattern of expected behaviors associated with a certain position in society . as roles become highly complex structures , they are called institutions ( ie , ways of taking care of basic human needs ) . in brief , institutions are socially approved patterns of behavior .\nthe various institutions of a society are crescive in nature and have a strain of consistency , which simply means that they develop over time and they are all interrelated .\nhealth care as an institution , therefore , can not be fully understood unless it is examined in itself as well as in relation to other institutions such as the family , social welfare , government , education , religion , and other organizational structures in the society . a society , from one perspective ,\ncan be viewed as falling somewhere between two polar pure types , ideal types or mental constructs as either gemeinschaft or gesellschaft in orientation , or perhaps rural and urban ( fig 1 ) .\nthe scp model from a macroscopic perspective represents the global village , a nation , a community , an institution or group ( fig 1 ) .\nthere are a multitude of subsystems , comparable with subsystems in the human body , operating in any of these aggregates . for purposes of analysis , we will isolate a simple subsystem , namely , the personality subsystem .\nthis subsystem involves the socialization or learning process ( sp ) ; nature ( n1 ) , which is the genetic basis , and nurture ( n2 ) , or environment , which is the social or cultural basis in any society between the gemeinschaft ( g1 ) and the gesellschaft ( g2 ) dichotomy ( fig 1 ) . the genetic ( or natural ) basis of personality is the combination of traits that results from the person 's unique constellation of genes .\nthese potentialities , when developed under the influence of the total environment in which the individual 's orientation takes place , are shaped into a personality .\nhence , the formation of the personality is one of integrating the individual 's experience with his or her physical qualities to form a mutually adjusted , functioning whole .\nthis takes place in childhood and adolescence and results in the development of distinctive physical as well as emotional responses .\nthe personality system , therefore , is the totality of the actor 's personal needs in the cultural world in which he or she interacts . within the personality system\nthe self - concept involves the assumption that personalities act according to the way they perceive themselves ( their self - concept ) and according to the way they perceive the social situation .\nsocial situations are all forces acting upon the individual at any given moment in time .\nthe finished product is acquired through socially meaningful interaction ( smi)the nucleus of the cell of society .\nthe smi is linked to socialization , a learning process in a social environment ( n2 ) , where the value - attitude system ( vas ) of a culture is internalized ( fig 2 ) .\nthe socialization process is linked to the health care system through health behavior , illness behavior , and the sick role .\nthey permeate the life cycle from the moment of conception until natural death ( fig 2 ) .\nthe life cycle can be viewed in terms of the prenatal ( from conception [ x ] to birth ) and postnatal from birth to natural death ( d ) ( fig 2 ) . in the prenatal stage ,\nthis network can be interrupted by environmental factors such as fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs used by the mother .\nfetal alcohol syndrome ( fas ) can lead to serious mental retardation caused by maternal alcohol abuse .\nresearch indicates the fact that 1200 to 8000 fas babies are born annually in the united states . during the socialization process in the life cycle ,\nchildren born into poverty struggle against serious odds to achieve optimal health and well - being . lifestyles and health behaviors\nfor instance , persistent exposure to poverty and other social problems , family violence , and alcohol abuse increases a child 's chances of adopting similar behavioral patterns . on the whole , children socialized in poverty may be at greater risk for poor health .\nchildren who are born to single mothers who may be homeless , and may have poor educational attainment , may put the infant at similar risk for inadequate health care and poor access to preventive and health care services . as a result , the mother and the infant may both be affected by insufficient health care in impoverished neighborhoods and societies . in the socialization process of the postnatal stage of the life cycle , it is to be noted that living in communities with high levels of air pollution is directly related to an increased incidence of respiratory illnesses in children .\nchildren who live in certain environments surrounded by nuclear power plants and/or toxic waste sites are at greater risk of various illnesses especially as their bodies are still in the process of development .\nthese children may experience extreme challenges in receiving adequate health care because of lack of health insurance .\nindeed it is to be noted that people who live in poverty receive suboptimal health care .\nfor example , children who are poor are twice as likely to be in poor health , and they have a greater probability of being hospitalized for short periods of time ( fig 2 ) . in the postnatal stage of the life cycle ( fig 2 ) , the socialization process in relation to the health care institution is linked to several behavioral science theories such as cooley 's looking - glass self .\nthis theory and others are most applicable to therapists in the health care system . in the area of gerontology , the activity and disengagement theories play vital roles in the lives of the elderly irrespective of the location of the society and culture on the continuum between the gemeinschaft and gesellschaft dichotomy ( fig 2 ) .\nthe socialization process in relation to the health care institution is most helpful in the diagnosis , treatment , and prognosis of several illnesses and disorders .\nadult population experiences a depressive disorder . additionally , anxiety disorders are a most prevalent group of psychiatric illnesses among children and adults .\nother common disorders include dyslexia , which is revealed when a child learns to read , and antisocial behavior , which involves behaviors from lying and bullying to vandalism and homicide .\nit should be noted that antisocial behaviors , however , are most prevalent in boys who tend to inflict physical harm on others .\neating disorders , however , are ailments that are most common in american teenage girls and young women as only 5% to 15% of anorexics or bulimics and 35% of binge eaters are male . given the above , the concept of the socialization process in the behavioral sciences in health care is directly related to the scp model especially from the perspective of poverty in the united states and around the world . according to william spencer ,\nthe following statistics give us an indication how widespread the poverty crisis is in the united states .\nthe poverty rate for america 's population over 65 stands at 9.7 percent , or one in ten seniors . at 16 million ,\nthe child poverty rate in the u.s . is 18% , between two and four times higher than other major industrialized nations .\nthe poverty rate for america 's population over 65 stands at 9.7 percent , or one in ten seniors . at 16 million ,\nthe same study shows that poverty , however , is not only a socioeconomic issue facing the united states but also the international community as well .\nthe findings demonstrate that : an estimated 1.4 billion of the world 's people live in extreme poverty , on under $ 1.25/day .\none quarter of all children in developing countries are at risk of experiencing long - term effects of undernourishment .\nover 1 billion people do not have access to sanitation , and over 30,000 children die of preventable diseases every day .\nan estimated 1.4 billion of the world 's people live in extreme poverty , on under $ 1.25/day . over 2.6 billion people\none quarter of all children in developing countries are at risk of experiencing long - term effects of undernourishment .\nover 1 billion people do not have access to sanitation , and over 30,000 children die of preventable diseases every day .\nwe shall now consider a synthesis of additional concepts and theories within the institutions of the family and health care in relation to the scp model .\nthe family is the most permanent of all social institutions and fundamental to the socialization process of the individual .\nthe family is , without question , the oldest and most prevalent of all human institutions .\nthe family is related to health by the fact of biological inheritance of some disease entities .\ndiseases such as sickle cell anemia , rh factor incompatibility , and tendencies to diabetes , tuberculosis , and poor dentition are examples of entities passed by the family through the gene pool .\nteeth that are darker lose their enamel easily when compared with normal teeth and are more likely to wear down to the gum line . indeed , the  family is the unit of medical care because it is the unit of living . \nfor example , it acts as a biological and social heritage from one generation to another .\nhowever , one undisputed function of the family is the socialization of its nucleus into the society . in general\n, the term socialization is used to describe the ways in which the individual learns the values , beliefs , and roles that underwrite the social system in which he or she participates . the sick role developed in the socialization process\nfor example , a patient may act out his or her sick role in relation to the members of a health care team ( chiropractic physicians , physicians , administrators , nurses , the chaplain , his family , osteopathic physicians ) and the other members of society in the manner in which he or she has internalized this role from infancy ( fig 3 ) .\nfamily roles can be seriously affected by illness , bringing about a reshaping of roles and role responsibilities .\nrole reversal between parents is a common one , in which the breadwinner 's responsibility is switched and patterns of child care may need to change .\nfor example , if a longshoreman loses his leg through an on - the - job accident , he will no longer be able to act out his occupational role as the use of both legs would be necessary for him to perform his work successfully .\nthese transitions can be sources of confusion in identity for children during the early developmental stages especially if there had been prior inadequate role performances on the part of the parents toward their children .\nthe family also influences health care through its effects on nurture ( n2 ) or environment of the individual ( fig 3 )\n. a family of 10 who is crowded into an inadequate home without sufficient heat and enough finances for balanced meals will be more likely to become ill , and the individual 's view of health will reflect his or her experience under such living conditions . in an early study , komarovsky examined family life in newark during the great depression of the 1930s to determine the impact the father 's unemployment had on familial roles .\nshe found that the loss of the breadwinner 's role sometimes had serious and tragic effects on the man 's self - esteem and on his formerly affectionate and authoritative relationships with his wife and children .\nin such cases , husbands viewed themselves as humiliated and came to feel neurotic because of so much free time and nothing to do ; wives were bitterly disappointed at their husbands ' socially defined economic failure .\ngiven the role of the family in relation to health care , we will turn our attention now to the structure of the family to grasp a better understanding of the interdependence of these two institutions in the scp model ( fig 3 ) .\nevery social institution has some sort of structure or framework that helps to put concepts or purposes of the institution into the world of action so that it can serve the interest of society and the members who compose it .\nthe family as a social institution has its framework or structure within which it can carry out the purposes for which it exists .\nthe first is the family of origin ( orientation ) in which our earliest experiences take place .\nthe second is the family of marriage ( or procreation ) in which we may enact the role of parent .\nit is within the network of familial relationships that we develop our attitudes and values toward health and illness .\nthe family as we have noted earlier is the most universal of all human institutions .\nit varies widely in structure from the consanguinal type ( ie , extended kin groups , which include a wide variety of related persons ) to conjugal families consisting simply of an adult pair ( male and female ) and their children .\nthe conjugal family acts as a source of  refuge  in mass society  a place where the individual may engage in genuinely personal relationships in a world that is largely impersonal . in the past , many authors have given us a description of different types of families .\nsorokin , for example presents 3 types : namely , the compulsive , the contractual , and the familistic ( fig 3 ) . in the compulsive family , the bond holding members together is not love but force and the relationship is based on exploitation , cruelty , and deprivation .\nthe contractual type brings profit and advancement to the participants but is devoid of love and hatred .\nthe familistic type is based on mutual love between the spouses , and it is characterized by devotion , sacrifice , solidarity , sharing , permanence , and stability .\nsorokin feels that the 3 types of families have been present regardless of one 's society but have changed in proportion with time .\nthe contractual family , however , is the largest one in today 's western world .\nthe type of family a person comes from can help us understand the behaviors of the patient and members of the family toward the sick person .\nfor example , in severe coronary cases , increasing demands are made on the family to adjust their customary routines to the patient 's needs .\none can expect , therefore , that if the family type was close ( familistic ) , in which each member was concerned about the others prior to the illness , then there could be a greater willingness for members of the family to adjust their roles to help the sick person .\non the contrary , if the family type was contractual and/or compulsive , then the family members would be less willing to make the sacrifices to aid the sick individual .\nstructure within the institution of the family plays an essential role in the way stress is handled during a sudden crisis .\nthe outcome of such a crisis will depend upon the type of familial relationship prior to the episode .\nresearch done at the family medicine unit at harvard medical school have demonstrated rather clearly that : . . .\ncommon crises such as death of grandparents , change of residence , a loss of a father 's job , and a child 's being subjected to unusual pressure , occur four times more frequently in the two week period prior to the appearance of streptococcal infection than in the two weeks afterward . . .\ncommon crises such as death of grandparents , change of residence , a loss of a father 's job , and a child 's being subjected to unusual pressure , occur four times more frequently in the two week period prior to the appearance of streptococcal infection than in the two weeks afterward .\nthe same studies have shown that : age , intimacy of contact , and family organization influenced the susceptibility to streptococcal infection .\nchildren of school age were most susceptible , and a spread of infection to other family members sharing the same bedroom was likely .\nage , intimacy of contact , and family organization influenced the susceptibility to streptococcal infection .\nchildren of school age were most susceptible , and a spread of infection to other family members sharing the same bedroom was likely .\nadditional research demonstrates that  streptococcal and staphylococcal infections are family disorders , and successful management responses requires consideration of the family group . \nanother kind of crisis in which the type of family plays an important role is the biological inheritance factor .\nif one learns that he or she is a cause of disease that affects children or learns that he or she is a recipient of a disease of a familiar nature , this knowledge can bring about complicated emotional problems in family interaction .\nfor example , the birth of a deformed infant may be accompanied by a guilt reaction on the part of both parents .\none can speculate about the emotional disturbances of the family in the specific case of muscular dystrophy , which is carried by the female and attacks the male .\nthe need of a parent to deny knowledge about such discomforting facts is understandable ; however , there is a tendency for the parent to believe the facts must be disproved and to continually seek out advice in order to get different answers . at this stage of the crisis\n, there is a great need to see the family as a unit of treatment .\nwhether or not the family is viewed as such will depend partially upon the type of familial relationships prior to the episode\n. another important role of the family is the patient - physician relationship concerning the care at the end of life .\nthough many health care professionals are often uncomfortable discussing death and dying with their patients and families and believe such discussion would be too difficult emotionally and thus ineffective for the patient and family , a recent study has shown that the reverse is true .\n. it can be the equivalent of a full - time job for 20% of caregivers and result in further financial burden .\nthe average annual costs for caregiving in the united states can range from $ 3 billion to $ 6 billion .\nthese stressors often lead families to seek long - term care ( ltc ) placement .\ncaregivers who are older ( > 65 years of age ) who feel a greater sense of burden are more likely to have their loved one in a ltc facility .\nalthough many caregivers experience symptoms of anxiety and depression ( 15% to 20% ) prior to placement in an ltc facility , these symptoms did not change after placement , particularly true for spouses .\ntwo recent studies found that caregivers often experience a sense of relief after the passing of a loved one , when it was preceded by ongoing suffering and significant burden to the caregiver .\none study suggests that , in addition to the known risk of psychiatric morbidity of caregiving , there is a 60% higher risk of caregiver death when compared with non - caregiver controls . in recognizing the burden of caregiving , rabow et\nal recently proposed 5 areas of opportunities for caregivers to be of service to the family .\nthese are ( a ) promote communication , ( b ) promote advanced care planning and decision making , ( c ) support home care , ( d ) demonstrate empathy for patients and their families , and ( e ) participate in family grief and bereavement . in providing compassion and empathy ,\nwith the inclusion of the behavioral sciences component in the national board examinations , many professional schools in the health care institution have included sociology , psychology , and anthropology in the training of their students\n. however , the extreme shortage of qualified social scientists , who are capable of relating the behavioral sciences to the health care institution , makes it difficult to meet the needs of graduate and professional schools everywhere . in view of this problem\n, this article has synthesized 2 conceptual frameworks , the socialization process and the institution of the family , with the scp model .\nthe scp model is an organizational device for integrating the components of the socialization process and the family in relation to the health care institution .\nthis model is especially adapted to the needs of future health care professionals ( chiropractic physicians , physicians , dentists , nurses , osteopathic physicians , and others ) who may not have had the opportunities to be fully introduced to the behavioral sciences in health care .\nwe have synthesized the socialization process through society , culture , and personality . we have noted that the learning process commences from the prenatal and continues into the postnatal through natural death .\nthe socialization process is essentially a learning process related to health behavior , illness behavior , and the sick role of the patient .\nwe have noted that the family is the most permanent of all social institutions and it is the basic socializing agency for the individual . the sick role , internalized during the socialization process within the family , involves an individual 's response to his or her illness .\nthe patient acts out the sick role in relation to the chiropractic physician , physician , dentist , nurse , the family , and the other members of society .\nin addition to being the major socializing agency , the family also influences health care through its functions of nurture ( environment ) and nature ( biological inheritance ) .\nthe structure of the family can also help the health care giver understand the behavior of the patient and his or her family 's background .\nwhether the family is compulsive , contractual , or familistic will have an effect on a patient 's attitude and perception of the illness .\nthe structure of the family influences familial interactions and relationships as well as the way in which the family is able to handle stressful situations .\neven though only a few concepts and theories have been examined within the socialization process and the institution of the family , the scp model can be used to relate other major concepts and theories such as social processes , social class , disease prevention , epidemiology , and the community to the scp model , in so far as these concepts are relevant to the education and delivery of care by future health professionals ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " objectivethe purpose of this article is to offer aspects of a conceptual model that can be applied as an organizational instrument for aiding preclinical and clinical chiropractic students to develop a thorough understanding of their roles among the next generation of health care providers for the 21st century.discussionit is necessary for chiropractic physicians to comprehend the basis of the society - culture - personality model as an organizational device in the health care institution . \n the structure of the family and the socialization process as conceptual components of the model may allow an enriched understanding of their interrelationships and thereby could expand and provide quality care for patients as a whole.conclusionthe society - culture - personality model has the potential for synthesizing the features of the socialization process and the family in relation to the institution of health care . \n this model is particularly appropriate for the needs of the next generation of health care professionals ( chiropractic physicians , physicians , dentists , nurses , and osteopathic physicians ) who may not have had the chance to be exposed entirely to the behavioral sciences in health care .
