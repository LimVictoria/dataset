How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Your stomach problems, indigestion, and burning sensation seem to be associated with APD (acid peptic disease). It is common in males. So, you should visit a general surgeon and he will examine and look for any local hemorrhoids, anal fissure (tear), fistula, etc. If he cannot find any such thing, He will refer you for colonoscopy and if needed for gastroscopy (less chances) plus they will advise some basic blood tests. Usually, if the blood coming with stools is reddish, it is mainly through the colon, rectum, or anal area and if the blood is coming from the stomach and above, it will change the color of stool to black. So, there will be blackish stool. The various causes of bleeding coming with stools are: All these are noncancerous causes and the last one is colon, rectal or anal cancer. In your age group, it is not so common to have colon or gastric cancer unless some genetic or hereditary factors are involved and cancer is usually associated with significant weight loss, decreased appetite, etc. For more information consult a medical oncologist."}]}

First of all, sperm can live in the female genital tract for up to five days.

Furthermore, modern pregnancy tests are extremely sensitive, and can become positive even 10 days after conception. However, if the test is not performed correctly, or if the test is left out too long beyond the time recommended to read the test on the package, a faint line can appear.

A granuloma is where an infection may have happened once, as your doctor said, in the last 10 years or before. This infection could have been anything like a tuberculosis to maybe some minor lesion. Now the body fights infections on its own. So the infection may have never come to the surface. But the body must have fought off the infection. However some damage may have been left back.Now the body usually responds by depositing calcium in such spots- whether in brain, or in any other body part. This deposition occurs over a long period of time- hence we say maybe the infection occurred 10 years back. The lesion in itself is inactive. The problem however is that it is in brain. So if the lesion is calcified in brain, especially in cortex, it makes her prone to seizures. The brain works on electrical signals. The calcific spot forms a lesion that changes this electrical field and makes it abnormal. This abnormal electrical field may be going on, and may be under control. But with right set of conditions, a seizure can develop. This set of conditions can include a lack of sleepexcess coffee/teastaring at blinking lights too longtoo long television gazing etcBrain surgery should be avoided as far as possible. However you can discuss with the doctor the need of prophylactic antiepileptic drugs. Personally, I would avoid them till at least the first seizure episode. Before that just avoid the triggers.Testing a Mantoux test, ESR, TB Quantiferon gold test may help. I hope this helps you."}]}

Montek LC tablet is a combination of levocetirizine and montelukast; levocet being an antihistamine and montelukast being a leukotriene inhibitor that works well for the airways. He will also need a lung function test with reversibility studies to see if he has developed asthma or is in the early stages. Only then the recommendation of bronchodilators as inhalers can be made. Asthalin is a short acting bronchodilator that he can use whenever he feels short of breath but it is important that he keeps a note of the number of times and puffs he has used to let the chest physician know when the lung function report is in front of him.

The tingling sensation in the lower front teeth can be because of the attrition secondary to bruxism or maloclusion like deep bite. The other possible cause can be because of the cervical abrasion due to abnormal forces while brushing or it can be secondary to gingival recession because of gum infection. Nothing to be panic, consult a oral physician and get it ruled out. If it is a attrition secondary to malocclusion, it has to be treated with braces. If it is secondary to the cervical abrasion then it can be restored with glass ionomer cement. If it is a gum infection, then the teeth has to be cleaned.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.You have probably have developed an infection of hair follicles in the area, called folliculitis. It is may be due to excessive sweating or moisture, friction against undergarments or clothes, etc., which caused the follicles to be prone to infection even without shaving. You may have tiny pustules and boils at the hair base, discharge as you mentioned, pain, swollen lymph nodes, and fever. We also must rule out a probable fungal infection in the area with secondary infection. There may have been in contact with someone who has an infection, even through infected towels, clothing, and toiletries. It could also have started as an allergy to hygiene products / cosmetics / sanitary napkins / synthetic clothing, etc., leading to rashes with discharge. Try to narrow down on the possible cause. You will need to apply an antibiotic cream like Fusidin twice daily after cleaning the area gently with water. Do not rub or itch. No powders for now. Oral antibiotic course such as Augmentin is advised. In case of allergy and itching, you can take an antihistamine like Levocet. Pain can be helped by an Ibuprofen orally.I would advise you to visit the dermatologist if it does not show signs of healing in 2 to 3 days. Exact diagnosis needs to be made to treat a fungal infection or allergy differently. Testing of the pus will also help to find out infecting bacteria and treat you with best antibiotic medication for your infection. Anything that you suspect may have caused allergy must be avoided.

You can take a banana flower after cooking, and jamun fruits can be consumed more if the bleeding is more. If you can collect the bark of jamun tree, then its kashayam is the best one to stop the bleeding. Make it as small pieces of the bark. Take 20 grams of the cut barks, add 250 ml of water, and boil it in a mild flame. Once the water is reduced to 100 ml, then stop firing it. Filter it, and this is called as jamun bark kashayam.

Despite great advances in organ transplantation in the last four decades, herpesvirus infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality for a majority of transplant recipients.

When the baby takes milk, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a wave form which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out. This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting. You need not worry.

Based on your query, my opinion is as follows - The elevated hemoglobin, red blood cell count and hematocrit signify polycythemia. Elevated Vitamin B12 level is one of the markers of myeloproliferative disorder. I would strongly think of polycythemia vera. Other values are within normal range (attachment removed to protect patient identity) suggest no renal or liver disorders. Increased hematocrit will slow down blood flow due to increased viscosity and this can cause few RBC to move out and lead to these symptoms. Even migraine, bone pain and increased itching can be attributed to sluggish blood flow. Polycythemia vera is a cancerous condition and requires evaluation. I would strongly urge you to meet hematologist. Hope there are no other causes of polycythemia like lung disorders or staying in hilly regions, etc. With high vitamin B12 and polycythemia, polycythemia vera needs to be seriously evaluated.

Added to this breathing trouble, wheezing, mucus production in lower airways are signs of asthma which signifies allergies of deeper air tracts. These two constitute the presentations of the hyper-reactive airway. It is also termed airway hyper responsiveness. The best way to treat allergy is to find the offending agent or what we call the allergen. Once that is done we can give small subclinical doses of allergen into your body to make you immune to the allergen. This is called immunotherapy. Before we subject you to immunotherapy we first want you to take a skin prick test. Various common allergens of your area are injected in small doses in skin intra serially and response noted. Positive response to allergens noted. Specific immunoglobulin E produced against these allergens are measured in the blood by tests. After quantifying immunotherapy is started. Any other form of treatment is only symptomatic. Only immunotherapy can give you lasting relief from allergy. If however, you require immediate temporary relief from allergy, you may take the symptomatic treatment which usually consists of a short course of steroids, intra nasal steroid sprays, antihistaminic and leukotriene inhibitors. These drugs are prescribed by the medical practitioner and if you require those kindly revert back to me. I will be happy to help you with the drugs and their correct dosage and how to take them. I must also say avoidance of allergen plays a great role in keeping allergy at bay."}]}

There you are wrong. Then naturally you say: 'I am taking Iron tabs regularly' as if iron will take care of your anaemia. You are lost to find reasons for your sickness. Conventional medicine cannot answer your question. Your case has to be studied in detail. Your parent's history, their disease tendencies, your intra uterine life, your past history, treatment history etc. become important. While taking your case in detail we will concentrate on your genetic constitutional dispositions to find out your remedy. This can be done by a very detailed case taking and analysis by an expert Homoeopathic physician.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The dominant is located along the left midshaft and is located outside tunica albuginea compressing it, but within Buck s fascia , and measures approximately 2 cm in longest dimension. Tunica albuginea in mildly thinned. There is mild increased enhancement underlying the lesion within the corpus canvernosum. The second nodule is located at the left base of the penis outside the tunica albuginea and within the Buck s fascia. The third is located along the right shaft and is centered on the tunica albuginea, disrupting it, involving the underlying corpus cavernosum and overlying the pericavernosal space. The dominant nodule demonstrates small heterogeneous poorly enhancing foci. The 3 similar nodules corresponds to the hyperechoic nodules on Ultrasound. There is an 8mm nodule located along the dorsal right proximal shaft with different signal characteristics. Ages lobe in signal on T1 and T2, with peripheral enhancement. The nodule appears to be located in the superficial subcutaneous space and indents the corpus cavernosum. The solitary nodule corresponds to the hypoechoic nodule on ultrasound. Glands penis, corpus spongiosum are normal. Urethra is normal. Impression: Three penile nodules some involving the tunica and some extrinsic to it.

My name is Toni and I was wondering if a referral to a rheumatologist would be the best thing for me. I take Cymbalta for unknown nerve pain causes in hands arms legs feet, back and neck pain, and I would say tendon problems. also depression which I think was cause from the pain being untreated and facing the unknown future of my heath. after about 6 weeks of being on this I started to mostly feel like my self again so I start doing more housework like I used to be able to do over 5 months ago. little to be known I star having hip and shoulder pain and I would say is a 4 or 5 on the pain scale. I was told by one doctor I have RLS and was put on 50mg ?tramazone? for this originally. then had to be uped to 100mg because it was not affective. new doctor says that not even what that is for and now I have recently just started on Requip for that. my vitamin d level was 15.8 a few months ago and the norm is about 30 from what I hear so I take 5000 iu a day for that. I have only had blood test done. Also emg came back great. although no x-rays no cat scans, no MRI have been done. I don t know what all auto immune disorders I have been tested for but those came back fine. normal blood work ok along with vitamin D, Iron test are in the process. I'm pretty frustrated at this point and really want some answers. my new doctor is really nice and seems to care. I just feel its time to see a specialist and want to know what you think about that, what kind of specialist, how to approach my doctor with this? Please help :-("}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, from what you have said it appears that you have tried at least 3 different medicines (Cymbalta, Trazodone and Requip) but still have pain in multiple joints. Normal tests are reassuring. The one thing I did not see in there was physical therapy. If you have not done that I would recommend discussing with your primary doctor about that. Its also possible that you may have an underlying depression contributing to your symptoms (since they improved with Cymbalta, an antidepressant). So, it might be worth discussing with your doctor about behavioral therapy or seeing a psychiatrist to determine if depression is contributing to your physical symptoms. Pool therapy (swimming / water exercises) are often very helpful too. I do not feel strongly about seeing a specialist, I would suggest discussing your frustrations with your primary doctor and the things I discussed above and work with him/her. But if you feel your concerns are not being addressed, you can always seek a second opinion from a different primary care physician."}]}

All attempts at forcing her to eat must be stopped. There must be no persuasion on your part, no coaxing, no bribing, no threatening, and no punishment. All tricks to make her eat must be absolutely stopped. No walking about the room. She should sit up at the table and eat the food or leave it. No negative attitude if she does not eat and no suggestion that she is being naughty. Your daughter should not be prevented from doing what she wants to do because she has not eaten her dinner. If she does not want the meal, it should be taken from her. There should be nothing between meals. This includes milk. She must wait until the next regular mealtime. If it happens again at next meal, she should still be left without food. She will soon eat when she gets hungry and no one makes a fuss about what she eats. You may allow her to eat some of the meat course, then dessert, and return to the meat. You should make it plain that the food in front of her is all there is and that if she does not like it, she can leave, but that is all there is. Make her food attractive, with bright colors. Put a small amount on her plate and let her ask for more. There should be variety so she does not get tired of one food.  With her poor appetite, give her no more than a pint of milk per day. She should be allowed to help prepare the meal, helping with potatoes, fruit, and pastry.  Allow to have meals with her parents or other children. If she is playing with her food when the rest of the table has been cleared and washing up has been done, her food should be removed. If she cries, make no fuss, just allow a reasonable amount of time for her to eat, and then without any threats or argument, remove the food. See that she gets as much outdoor exercise as possible and avoid over-fatigue. A healthy three-year old needs 11-12 hours of sleep over a 24 hour period. Hope I have answered your query.

Chemotherapy is a life saving treatment and is targeted to eliminating cancer or controlling the progress of disease in a patient with cancer. To provide chemotherapy, a patient should be fit enough medically to withstand the stress associated with the treatment. Having a heart problem should be carefully analyzed.

Some of the chemotherapy drugs are cardiotoxic and therefore such medicines might be avoided for your husband. Please have a detailed discussion with your doctor on this subject. The diagnosis changing from mesothelioma to any other malignant lesion requires another biopsy confirmation. Cancer should not be under treated or treated with wrong set of medicines if it is known that the patient has a particular cancer.

Xtraglo contains Biotin as the main active ingredient. Biotin has an added advantage in hair loss treatment. It promotes utilization of protein in hair and thus plays a role of an adjunctive treatment, though it is not a specific treatment modality for androgenetic alopecia. Minoxidil can cause a dull headache if used in excess of the recommended amount (i.e 1 ml, twice daily); occasionally it may cause dryness, scaling but that is mainly because it is available in an alcohol base. Otherwise it has no side effects. Biotin too is safe to use. Finasteride may cause transient side effects like loss of libido and sexual drive in 1-2% of patients but it is totally reversible and most patients report that they no longer feel this side effects on continued treatment. The response to treatment is slow and it varies from individual to individual and can only be judged if you use the prescribed medicines for at least 3-6 months before finally deciding on how are they going to work for you. The recommendation is to use these medicines for an initial 3-6 months for noticeable improvement and for up to 2 years for full effect. Thereafter, you may switch to a maintenance regime i.e once daily or alternate days minoxidil and once daily finasteride for the rest of your life. Regards"}]}

The serum creatinine level goes up due to urinary obstruction, probably the right kidney stone in your mother. Since the obstruction was present for some time in the past, the kidney function might have got affected. As per medical literature, a kidney stone causing obstruction for more than 10 days can cause obstructive uropathy which is  form of permanent damage leading to the kidney being unable to function properly. The raised creatinine is a consequence of this obstruction and a level of 1.4 is borderline high. It is most likely that the kidney was not much affected by the duration of obstruction by the stone. Serum creatinine is to be repeated after 2 - 3 months and it will most likely come down to normal. Since she is having diabetes and hypertension, regular kidney function tests should be done every 6 months. Creatinine can also rise due to hypertension and diabetes."}]}

If laboratory tests are normal then kidney infection is less likely.One of the possibilities which still holds good for your pain is the passage of a small stone through the urinary tract. This causes significant pain even after the stone passes out. The scans do not show any stone because it was passed out over few hours before doing the scan.

Smooth muscles in ureter contract excessively to overcome this obstruction by stone & cause severe colicky pain.

Child's mind is very delicate and easily moldable. Subtle things can cause drastic and unexpected effect on them, which we cannot even predict at times. In your case, it is quite easily observable to you. It is good that you could recognize this change in her behavior so early and decided to take an opinion for the same without wasting further time. Violence and rage have very severe effect on a child's mind. This is what happened with your daughter. The violence depicted in the movie and the reactions caused by that violence in the movie characters have made a deep impact on her mind. The fear caused by that violence had got imprinted on her mind. This can be the beginning of development of an underlying anxiety illness in her. So, it is very important for you as a parent to help her overcome this. You have to gradually make her aware that though the terrorist are the ones who spread violence and chaos, but on the other hand there are good people also who stop them. To begin with storytelling is a good way to inculcate things. Then play therapy can help. You can get her into play activities where you can strengthen her faith that there is no need to be afraid of bad guys and there are always good guys to help with. Gradually start taking her out and expose her to the people in neighborhood. Tell her about different kind of people living nearby. Familiarize her with the surroundings. Besides this, you should avoid watching content depicting violence and rage in front of your daughter. Child's age is a tender part of their life, they learn very quickly. So, use this as a therapy to manage her fear."}]}

Based on that, you will be advised simple medication and physical therapy. As, you are 56 year old, there may be a possibility of soft tissue damage in the knee joint where it is swollen and painful as well. Also, due to ageing of tissues and wear and tear of the soft tissues, the mechanical changes occurs in the soft tissue which can allow it to get injure and give symptoms of pain and swelling at any time.

As you had fall directly on the knee, there might be some ligament sprain or a small hairline fracture of the patella.

Also, when the swelling occurs it's a protective mechanism , and if you have applied ice the swelling will come down. So post that the MRI reports or X-ray reports should come to a conclusion. I will recommend to do some physical therapy as it will help improve the strength and mobility of the knee joint. The reason to undergo MRI and physical therapy is to avoid future pain and aches.
