deficiencies in any number of institutional factors may doom the intervention to failure .\nprotocol - driven care is central to tgc , with frequent assessment of glycemic levels and responding adjustments in the administered treatment\n. the experience and skill of the nursing staff in the use of protocols will materially affect the probability that the treatment goals of the protocol are achieved .\nmoreover , the structural and organizational characteristics of the icu may have a strong impact , especially in view of the high work burden imposed by tgc \nestimated to consume up to 2 hours out of a 24-hour working day for the icu nurse .\nglycemic reporting tools allow clinicians to know whether glycemic targets are being reached and , importantly , whether there is a significant rate of treatment - associated hypoglycemia .\nideally an icu should also have an outcomes reporting tool  the ability to provide information such as severity - adjusted mortality and length of stay , complications and resource utilization .\npositive feedback imparts a strong incentive to continue the effort needed to maintain effective implementation of tgc\n. one important difference between the early and later trials of tgc is the rate of treatment - associated severe hypoglycemia , defined as < 40 mg / dl , found recently to confer increased risk of mortality in a large cohort of mixed medical  surgical icu patients .\nthe leuven i study reported an increase in the number of patients with severe hypoglycemia from 0.8% to 5.1% , with no associated adverse consequences .\nin contrast , the percentages of patients in the corresponding groups of the leuven ii study were 3.1% and 18.7% ( 25.1% among patients in the icu for longer than 5 days ) .\nin this study the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia was independently associated with mortality on multivariable analysis and resulted in an attenuation of the survival benefit of tgc .\nsimilarly , the percentage of patients sustaining severe hypoglycemia among patients in the interventional arm versus the control arm of the glucontrol trial was 2.7% versus 9.8% ; the corresponding rates in the visep trial were 4.1% and 17.0% .\nit is possible that differences in monitoring technology and testing frequency may explain some of the differences in the rates of severe hypoglycemia when comparing the leuven 1 study , which exclusively used arterial blood from indwelling arterial catheters , with the later studies .\na growing literature has described the limitations of capillary glucose measurement in the critically ill patient , especially in the lower ranges targeted by these trials .\nit is likely that an additional factor  glycemic variability  has played a role in explaining the divergent outcomes of these different interventional trials .\na new evaluation of glycemic variability , defined as the standard deviation of the mean glucose level during the icu stay , suggests that glycemic variability may be an even more important predictor of mortality in the critically ill patient than is the mean glucose level .\nit is intriguing to note that while the mean ( standard deviation ) morning glucose levels of the control and interventional arms of the leuven i study were 153 ( 33 ) mg / dl versus 103 ( 19 ) mg / dl , the corresponding results for the leuven ii study were 153 ( 31 ) mg / dl versus 111 ( 29 ) mg / dl .\nglycemic control improved in the second study but , perhaps , glycemic variability was unchanged .\nwe are forced , ultimately , to conclude that the leuven i study may have set the bar too high : tgc , with a glycemic target of 80 to 110 mg / dl is , simply , too tight to practice safely and effectively .\nif tgc can not be implemented safely and effectively in a research setting leading to a published interventional trial , then it probably can not be implemented safely and effectively by most icu teams . instead of tgc\nsegc involves , first , adoption of a safe glycemic target appropriate to the skills , experience and available tools of the icu that does not result in a significant increase in the rate of hypoglycemia . a glycemic target of 80 to 150 mg / dl is not unreasonable for an icu to choose initially ; implementation can subsequently lead to downward revision of the glycemic goal .\nthe use of appropriate data monitoring tools , for both glycemic results and relevant clinical outcomes , is essential for segc . finally , sensible utilization of existing monitoring technologies is mandatory for segc .\npreliminary clinical evaluations of the accuracy of continuous or near - continuous glucose monitors have been published recently [ 23 - 25 ] .\nthese devices offer the promise of a reduction in severe hypoglycemia , glycemic variability and the nursing work burden , and will probably become a cornerstone of segc .\nthe goals of the segc mandate team collaboration are to create and apply glycemic protocols , and the appropriate use of all of the data and monitoring tools that we currently have in our armamentarium , as well as rapid employment of new tools as they are developed .\nicu = intensive care unit ; segc = safe , effective glycemic control ; tgc = tight glycemic control ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the impressive benefits related to the use of tight glucose control by intensive insulin therapy have not been reproduced until now in multicenter large - scale prospective randomized trials . \n although the reasons for these failures are not entirely clear , we suggest the use of a stepwise approach  safe , effective glucose control  that will essentially target an intermediate blood glucose level . as compared with genuine tight glucose control , safe , effective glucose control  already used in many intensive care units worldwide  is intended to decrease the rate of hypoglycemia and the workload , while reducing the adverse effects of severe hyperglycemia .

remitting clinical course.1 antibiotics are effective in the treatment of cd , especially in patients with complicated fistulas or abscesses.2 increasing evidence suggests that dysregulated gut microbiota play a role in the pathogenesis of cd.34 metronidazole is a widely used antibiotic in patients with cd.5 however , metronidazole may elicit neurotoxic effects including peripheral neuropathy , ataxia , seizure , and encephalopathy .\nmetronidazole - induced encephalopathy ( miep ) is a very rare but potentially reversible disease.67 the exact mechanism of miep remains unclear . here ,\nwe report the case of a cd patient who experienced encephalopathy immediately after a single intravenous ( iv ) dose of metronidazole following long - term exposure to the oral form of the drug .\na 64-year - old man who had been diagnosed with cd 17 years previously presented with altered mental status .\nhe received sulfasalazine and azathioprine as maintenance treatment for cd and was intermittently treated with prednisolone to achieve remission after flare - ups .\nhe had also received infliximab for the previous 3 years because of refractoriness to conventional treatment .\nfourteen years before beginning infliximab treatment , the patient underwent ileocecectomy due to intractable active cd .\nnine years after his first surgical treatment for active cd , he underwent right hemicolectomy and small bowel segmental resection to treat an intra - abdominal abscess communicating with multiple fistulas .\nhe underwent three additional bowel resections because of a recurrent wound infection with enterocutaneous fistulas .\nthe patient had taken 250 mg of metronidazole orally three times daily beginning 13 years previously .\nafter 8 years of treatment , however , he stopped taking metronidazole orally because of the side effect of peripheral neuropathy .\nhe received iv metronidazole treatments three times over the following 5 years when he experienced complications such as enterocutaneous fistulas or abscesses .\nsix months before the last admission , however , he restarted and continued oral metronidazole treatment for active cd .\nthe cumulative dose of metronidazole over the 6 months prior to the last admission was 111.75 g. his lifetime cumulative dose of metronidazole was approximately 2,000 g. the patient visited the hospital emergency department complaining of an abdominal wound problem which had been aggravated 2 days previously .\ninitial laboratory findings showed elevated crp ( 4.3 mg / dl ) , total bilirubin ( 4.9 mg / dl ) , and direct bilirubin ( 3.7 mg / dl ) , as well as prolonged pt ( inr of 2.07 ) .\nother laboratory findings were as follows : white blood cell count 8,100/mm , hemoglobin level 12.4 g / dl , platelet count 14010/l , cholesterol level 62 mg / dl , total protein level 5.6 g / dl , albumin level 2.8 g / dl , bun level 10 mg / dl , serum creatinine level 0.57 mg / dl , serum ast level 22\niu / l , serum alt level 16 iu / l , and serum alp level 61\nabdominal ct scans revealed a large enterocutaneous fistula in the middle portion of the patient 's abdomen ( fig .\n1 ) . considering the shortness of his small bowel , the patient received conservative treatment including parenteral nutrition and antibiotics for the treatment of the wound infection and enterocutaneous fistula .\nprior to iv metronidazole administration , the patient could follow commands and showed no motor weakness ( glasgow coma scale score of 15 ) . however ,\nhe abruptly became comatose ( glasgow coma scale score of 8) 2 hours after receiving a single 500 mg iv dose of metronidazole . on neurological examination\n, the patient could not open his eyes upon painful stimulation but could localize the pain bilaterally .\nall brainstem reflexes were normal . however , bilateral babinski signs were observed , suggestive of bilateral diffuse cortico - subcortical lesions .\nthe pupillary light reflex was intact , and there was no limitation of extraocular muscle movement .\nthe patient 's vital signs were normal at the time of metronidazole administration , with a blood pressure of 139/82 mmhg , heart rate of 86 beats per minute , respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute , and body temperature of 36.6. two hours after iv metronidazole administration , however , his blood pressure was 160/96 mmhg and his heart rate was 133 beats per minute .\nhowever , fluid - attenuated inversion recovery mri showed multiple high - intensity lesions in the bilateral subcortical white matter , medial thalamus , midbrain and pontine tegmentum , bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles , and cerebellar dentate nucleus ( fig .\n2 ) . based on clinical and radiological findings , a tentative diagnosis of miep was made .\na megadose of iv thiamine ( 500 mg ) was administered three times daily for 8 days .\nseven days after discontinuing metronidazole treatment , the patient was able to track moving objects .\non day 8 , a follow -

term safety of large cumulative doses of metronidazole has not been elucidated . in previous reports\n, patients who experienced miep or cerebellar ataxia were not exposed to larger cumulative doses of metronidazole than that received by our patient ; however , the association between neurotoxicity and the cumulative dose or duration of metronidazole treatment remains controversial.9,10 metronidazole - induced neurotoxicity typically occurs at doses exceeding 2 g / day for prolonged periods.79 thus , our patient may have been at high risk of miep because of an extremely high cumulative dose of metronidazole received over a period of 13 years .\nprevious history of long - term exposure to metronidazole should be considered to prevent neurotoxic effects such as miep in patients who require repeated treatment .\nprevious studies have shown that brain lesions identified by mri in miep patients are typically located in the cerebellar dentate nucleus , dorsal medulla , dorsal pons , midbrain , and splenium of the corpus callosum , with bilateral and symmetrical involvement.11 thus , the brain mri findings in this case were consistent with changes associated with miep . in this case , miep developed immediately after iv administration of a single dose of metronidazole following long - term oral metronidazole treatment .\ndifferences in the neurotoxic effects of oral versus iv metronidazole administration are not yet understood .\na previous study showed that the upper part of the small intestine is the main site of metronidazole absorption.12 manafi et al.13 found that absorption of orally administered metronidazole was significantly reduced by postoperative ileus .\ntherefore , a short bowel may be related to poor absorption of both nutrients and the metronidazole .\nthe peak serum level of metronidazole after iv administration in patients with a short bowel may be higher than that after oral administration .\nbecause metronidazole is mainly metabolized in the liver , severe liver dysfunction increases the drug 's half - life and increases the risk of miep.14 in our case , there were no clinical signs suggesting chronic liver disease or hepatic encephalopathy , although the patient had cholestasis and pt prolongation at admission .\nin addition , the abdominal ct scan showed neither cirrhotic changes nor mechanical biliary obstruction .\nthus , these transient abnormalities revealed by the liver function test may have been related to impaired hepatocyte transport function and systemic infection caused by bowel inflammation and bacterial overgrowth.15 liver function test results were stable for 2 weeks after admission and gradually returned to normal .\nin contrast , the patient 's mental status began to improve within a week after cessation of metronidazole treatment .\nthis temporal relationship supports the diagnosis of miep rather than hepatic encephalopathy . in this case\n, wernicke 's encephalopathy ( we ) may be another possible diagnosis , as acute we has clinical symptoms and brain mri findings similar to those of miep .\nmetronidazole metabolites inhibit thiamine pyrophosphokinase , and the resulting thiamine antagonism may also play a role in the pathogenesis of miep.16 however , the patient displayed altered mental status immediately after iv administration of metronidazole .\nthe temporal relationship between metronidazole administration and onset of neurological symptoms suggests a diagnosis of miep rather than we .\nmoreover , the patient showed no clinical signs of oculomotor dysfunction such as nystagmus and conjugate gaze palsy , which are typical clinical features of we.17 brain mri revealed diffuse high - intensity lesions in the bilateral subcortical white matter , medial thalamus , midbrain and pontine tegmentum , bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles , and cerebellar dentate nucleus , which are compatible with a diagnosis of miep .\nlesions in the dentate nucleus and red nucleus can also be found in patients with we , although these findings are atypical.18 the most common structures affected by we , as demonstrated by mri , are the medial thalamus and periventricular regions of the third ventricle.1920 in a systematic review of 64 patients with miep , mri revealed subcortical white matter lesions in approximately 50% of patients with altered metal status.9 however , high - intensity lesions in the bilateral subcortical white matter have not been detected in patients with we.911181920 these findings strongly suggest that miep is the primary cause of altered mental status in this case .\nnonetheless , the possibility of concomitant we could not be completely excluded because the patient was at high risk of thiamine deficiency due to malnutrition resulting from his short bowel status and was treated with thiamine .\nmoreover , the subtle cardiovascular signs observed in our patient , such as tachycardia , are frequently also observed in patients with acute we .\nbecause the patient 's serum thiamine level was not measured before thiamine replacement therapy , the possibility of concomitant we may be a limitation in this case study .\nwe report the first case of a patient with cd who experienced encephalopathy immediately after iv administration of a single dose of metronidazole following long - term oral metronidazole treatment .\nmiep may be a rare complication in cd patients , especially those at risk of malnutrition or who have received a high cumulative dose of metronidazole over a long period .\ntherefore , evaluation of nutritional status is very important in patients with ibd to prevent irreversible complications such as we.2122"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " metronidazole is a widely used antibiotic for the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections . \n metronidazole -

the interpretation of the lack of correlation is , however , hindered by a fairly homogenous study group . a matter of much debate is the role of maternal and infant contact with domestic animals .\nsome allergists consider that prolonged contact with domestic animals is a form of natural specific immunotherapy , effective particularly at the infant age , reducing hypersensivity to animal fur .\nthis phenomenon may be a result of tolerance achieved during natural exposition to high concentration of allergens .\nother authors postulate that the presence of a pet may result in the development of allergy and exacerbation of its symptoms .\n. the issue of whether we should present a cat to a small child still remains unresolved . in the present study , maternal contact with a cat during pregnancy\nresulted in increased incidence of antigen - specific immunoglobulins e against grass , cereals , and foods .\nthat may signal the role of cat allergens acting during pregnancy in the development of allergies . in contrast , maternal exposure to dog allergens during pregnancy was associated with decreased incidence of sige against grass and cereals ; a trend also seen regarding antibodies against domestic dust mites .\ngern et al .   also demonstrate less frequent hypersensivity and lower incidence of atopic dermatitis in infants remaining in a continuous contact with a dog since birth .\nsome suggest that maternal exposure to either type of smoking has a significant impact on ige levels in both maternal and fetal blood plasma and on the development of atopic diseases in early infancy ( 6 , 7 , 8) .\nbergman et al .   showed a high ige level in children of smoking fathers and even higher levels of it in children of smoking mothers .\nthis finding was explained by nonspecific stimulation of fetal ige production when exposed to low - intensity passive smoking and blockade thereof when faced with heavy exposure to tobacco smoke .\nhowever , many authors emphasize that no significant correlation between total ige level and smoking during pregnancy or maternal exposure to tobacco smoke has been found to - date . in the present study we did not find any correlation between parental smoking and total ige level either .\nnevertheless , it is worth pointing out that maternal or parental smoking was associated with higher incidence of sige against domestic dust mites .\nwe may presume that women living in an environment of tobacco smoke had greater contact with domestic dust mite allergens , and that may result in higher incidence of atopic diseases in the future . in conclusion , in the present study we demonstrate that increased total ige level in umbilical blood was associated with male gender , pathological pregnancy course , and the presence of atopic rhinitis in the family ; while lower ige levels were found in children having numerous siblings . increased levels of specific ige against grass , cereals , and food stuffs were associated with maternal contact with a cat , but not a dog , and with parental smoking during pregnancy ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the present study was conducted to learn whether the perinatal and environmental factors could influence the total and antigen - specific ige levels in umbilical cord blood . \n retrospective data were obtained from 173 mother - infant pairs . \n total and specific ( for children 's food , wheat / grass and house dust mite - hdm ) cord blood ige levels were determined using the immunoassay test . \n the total cord blood ige was between 0.0 - 23.08 iu / ml ( mean 0.55  2.07 iu / ml ;

thirds of patients with aecopd received the entire set of recommended care protocols in us hospitals,3 and that numerous participants received tests or treatments that were considered not beneficial .\nmularski and colleagues also concluded in 2006 that aecopd patients in the us received only 60.4% of the recommended care.4 randomized controlled trials , evidence -

smoker , and the attending physician applied the clinical pathway without confirming the smoking history .\nthe second reason was that the spirometric results were not available , and that the airflow limitation was not confirmed before the initiation of the clinical pathway .\nin addition , 13 subjects were excluded from further analysis due to a disappearance of their airflow limitation .\nthese patients successfully passed the initial screening , and an airflow limitation was confirmed at the initiation of the clinical pathway .\nnevertheless , the spirometry performed before discharge revealed that the fev1/fvc was over 0.7 ( ranging from 70.6% to 94.5% ) .\nthese patients were diagnosed with a reversible airflow limitation whose initial presentation was similar to aecopd .\nwe believe that these cases could not be excluded initially due to the difficulty in distinguishing an asthma exacerbation from an aecopd in some patients .\nthus , the remaining 276 hospitalizations of 165 patients were analyzed in the present study .\nthe average age of the patients , calculated with the total number of hospitalizations as the denominator , was 74.6 years . in 97 cases ( 35.1% ) , the patients were taken to the hospital by ambulance , and in 83 cases ( 30.0% ) , since the chest radiographs revealed infiltration compatible with pneumonia , they were diagnosed with a pneumonic exacerbation of copd .\nspirometry was performed in 248 out of 276 episodes after completing the treatment , and disease severity of copd was unknown in 28 hospitalizations ( 10.1% ) . according to the gold ( global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease ) criteria,1 there were 29 ( 10.5% ) , 81 ( 29.3% ) , 89 ( 32.2% ) , and 49 ( 17.8% ) episodes , respectively , of stage i , ii , iii , and iv . the post - bronchodilator fev1 was 0.99 l on average , and the fev1/fvc was 44.4% .\nthe length of stay was longer than 30 days in 34 admissions ( 12.3% ) , mainly due to complications .\nthe clinical pathway was completed in 231 out of 276 hospitalizations ( 83.7% ) , but was interrupted and regarded as a dropout in 45 hospitalizations ( 16.3% ) , see table 3 .\nnine patients ( 3.3% ) died during hospitalization due to the following reasons : two cases each of pneumothorax - related deaths , septic shock , and cerebral infarction ; one case each of nosocomial pneumonia , unconsciousness of unknown cause , and sudden death of unknown cause .\none of the two pneumothorax - related deaths occurred in a subject that had a bilateral pneumothorax that developed just after the introduction of nppv ; he received subsequent mechanical ventilation with intubation , but the treatment was unsuccessful . in the second pneumothorax - related death ,\nan autopsy revealed a collapse of the left lung in a patient who died unexpectedly on the third day after hospitalization .\nall of the fatal cases were due to complications after the initiation of the treatment , and were difficult to predict .\nseven patients ( 2.5% ) were transferred to other long - term care facilities ; four had families who refused their discharge to home , and the remaining three were transferred due to complications ( intertrochanteric hip fracture , cerebral infarction , and interstitial pneumonia ) . in 29 out of 45 dropouts , the patients did not complete the clinical pathway but were discharged home from the hospital after receiving various subsequent therapies . among the 29 dropouts who were discharged from the hospital , in nine hospitalizations , the reason for the dropout was only because the pulmonary rehabilitation was not performed , even though all other procedures scheduled in the clinical pathway were completed .\nthe other reasons for the dropouts were complications that appeared during the clinical pathway , including pneumonia in five cases , pleural effusion in three cases , a pneumothorax in two cases .\nnine cases that required intubation and the use of a mechanical ventilator following unsuccessful nppv treatment were also included in the dropouts .\noxygen was administered to 232 hospitalizations with a pressure of oxygen in arterial blood ( pao2 ) < 60 mm hg ( 84.1% ) .\nnppv treatment was administered in 110 hospitalizations with a pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood ( paco2 ) 45(50 ) mm hg or a ph < 7.35 ( 39.9% ) .\nforty - four hospitalizations without respiratory failure ( 15.9% ) were treated without oxygen administration and without nppv treatment , and 122 hospitalizations with a pao2 < 60 mm hg but without a paco2  45(50 ) mm hg or a ph < 7.35 ( 44.2% ) were treated with oxygen administration but without nppv treatment .\nthere were only three dropouts ( 6.8% ) among these 44 hospitalizations without oxygen administration and without nppv treatment .\nthere were 13 cases ( 10.7% ) of dropouts among the 122 hospitalizations with oxygen administration but without nppv treatment .\non the other hand , there were 29 dropouts ( 26.4% ) out of 110 hospitalizations with oxygen administration and nppv treatment .\ntherefore , the clinical pathway completion rates were 93.2% , 89.3% , and 73.6% , respectively , for these hospitalization groups .\nthe rate of intubation in those cases where nppv treatment had been administered once was 8.2% ( 9 cases out of 110 ) .\npulmonary rehabilitation was administered in 262 cases , and started on average 3.5 days ( median 3 days ) after admission .\nthe barthel index was recorded in 245 episodes , and the mean  standard deviation index value was 60.1  31.3 , ranging from 0 to 100 .\nthe six - minute walking distance was 199  533 and 268  660 meters in 210 episodes before versus after pulmonary rehabilitation , respectively .\nwe examined the hospital records and found a total of 62 copd - related hospitalizations that were not treated using the clinical pathway . among these 62 episodes\n, we could identify the reason why the clinical pathway was not applied in 25 aecopd episodes . in the remaining 37 episodes\n, it was not clear from the medical records whether the copd was stable or not , and it was difficult to identify the reason why the clinical pathway was not applied , even though these cases appeared to match the criteria for aecopd .\nour analysis of aecopd patients treated by a newly developed clinical pathway revealed two important findings .\nfirst , aecopd can be effectively treated using a clinical pathway . since all of the participants received all of the interventions listed in the clinical pathway , this pathway proved to be well tolerated and accepted , even in critically ill patients with aecopd .\nthe fact that we could apply all of the listed interventions to all of the patients suggests that the quality of care provided in our hospital had improved compared with the level of care before the introduction of the clinical pathway .\nsecond , the rate of dropouts from the clinical pathway was relatively low ( approximately 16% ) , and most of the dropouts were hypercapnic cases that required nppv treatment .\nthis low dropout rate suggests that the clinical pathway was highly adaptable to all patient conditions .\nthe mortality rate during hospitalization was less than 5% in the present study , further supporting the contention that the clinical pathway was safe and did not impose any significantly adverse effects , even on severely ill patients .\nunfortunately , it was impossible to compare the present study with a control group treated without the clinical pathway , because the present study was not a randomized controlled trial .\naecopd represents an extremely severe event that can occur at any point during the long course of copd .\naecopd can be lethal , and can impair a patient s health - related quality of life severely and permanently .\nthus , the first important step is to take measures to prevent aecopd from occurring among patients with stable copd . a comprehensive approach , including the use of drugs known to reduce the frequency of aecopd episodes , is necessary.10 as the second step ,\nif aecopd does occur , then it is important to promptly change the therapeutic regimen , and , if necessary , facilitate the patient s access to medical services .\npatient education and self - management involving action plans and behavior modification are among the critical issues associated with the second step.11 studies designed to include these approaches as a part of integrated care have resulted in favorable outcomes.12,13 the third step for managing aecopd is the actual treatment itself . for mild symptoms of aecopd , patients can be treated by unscheduled or emergency visits .\npatients suffering from moderate - to - severe symptoms of aecopd need to be hospitalized , and our study was designed to improve the quality of treatment at this final stage of the disease .\nsome clinicians may feel an aversion to the uniform treatment menu of a clinical pathway , especially because the severity of disease symptoms varies greatly among individual patients .\nindeed , it would be difficult to apply a clinical pathway for acute medical conditions that included critically ill cases .\nit is a reasonable concern that the uniform treatment applied by the clinical pathway might result in a failure of treatment for such diseases as aecopd , in which patients suffer from acute and severe conditions .\nthe same treatment under the clinical pathway may be an over - treatment for some patients with mild disease or an under - treatment for some patients with severe symptoms .\nfurthermore , since aecopd patients manifest qualitatively different clinical conditions , it can be argued that the treatments should be tailored to the condition of each patient .\nalthough these concerns are valid and important to consider , it is also important to provide a simple , practical , and easily applicable plan for those practitioners working at the forefront of medical services .\nwe believe that our study provided evidence suggesting that a clinical pathway for aecopd is both useful and practical .\none limitation of the present study is that it was not a randomized controlled trial which examined the impact of the clinical pathway as compared with aecopd patients treated in other ways . in the uk national copd audit 2003\n, it was reported that the inpatient mortality rate was 7.4% , and the mean los for discharged patients was 8.3 days ( median 6 days).2 in the 2005 scandinavian audit of copd hospitalizations , the overall in - hospital mortality was 3.7% , and the mean los was 8.6 days , although the los was longer than 10 days in 25% of the cases.14 in the us , stein and colleagues examined the nationwide inpatient sample from the years 20002006 using five different algorithms and concluded that the in - hospital mortality was 2.0%5.1% , and the median los was 4 days in patients hospitalized for aecopd.15 although the inpatient mortality in the western studies can be considered comparable to our study , the los in the hospital , which is less than 10 days in most western countries , is clearly longer in japan .\nthe los for all patients admitted to the kyoto - katsura hospital during the period of our study was around 17 days , and this value is about the same as the average los for general acute hospitalizations in japan . any possible additional cost may be attributed to the longer stay in japan .\nthe reason for this difference can be attributed to the different systems of health care delivery between the western countries and japan .\nthe problem in japan is that the number of hospitals per capita is very high , but the number of staff per hospital bed is extremely low , and thus the shortage of employees in medical facilities poses a more serious problem.16 however , in japan , there have been no reports on the therapeutic management of aecopd , and therefore there are no references to compare the results presented in this study .\nsome interventions , such as nppv , have been shown to be effective in selecting patients enrolled in clinical trials . however , few studies are available on the use of nppv as a routine standard medical protocol for patients with respiratory failure outside of these controlled trials . according to the report from schettino and colleagues,17\n87 patients with aecopd were treated by nppv in 2001 , and the rate of intubation associated with nppv failure was 24%.17 in our report , nppv treatment was administered in 97 hospitalizations ( 40% ) , and the rate of intubation in our nppv - treated cases was 8% .\nthis favorable rate can not be easily compared with the results reported by schettino and colleagues , but evidence of the effectiveness of nppv treatment to control hypercapnic aecopd is gradually accumulating , and appears to be infiltrating clinical practice .\nample evidence supports the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation for stable copd , but it remains controversial whether it should be applied during the acute phase of aecopd .\nevidence is now accumulating for the effectiveness of pulmonary rehabilitation during the recovery phase of aecopd.7 however , the optimal time to start pulmonary rehabilitation has not been clearly established.1820 in the current clinical pathway , we implemented pulmonary rehabilitation during the acute phase , and started interventions with a physiotherapist immediately after the vital signs , such as fever , became stable .\nmore clinical trials are needed to determine when to start pulmonary rehabilitation . in some cases\n, we felt that the clinical pathway would be inappropriate due to frequent and recurrent exacerbations , and we intentionally avoided using it for the benefit of these specific patients .\nin addition , although our clinical pathway was indicated for aecopd inpatients , each physician may have used different criteria to determine who should be hospitalized .\nthe absence of a uniform criterion for hospitalization might have introduced a bias into the outcomes of the clinical pathway in the present study .\nanother limitation of the present study is that our limited data precluded us from examining other indices often used in the literature , such as the re - admission rate , the rate of relapses , treatment failure , and adverse effects .\nthese parameters could be used to monitor the yearly performance of each hospital , and to compare each hospital against national standards .\nhowever , few studies have examined the cost of developing and implementing such an index , and how it may effectively change clinical practice to improve the outcomes of each hospital . the implementation of an inpatient clinical pathway for hospitalized asthmatic children led to a decrease in the los and a reduction in total cost , while improving the quality of care.21,22 similarly , a clinical pathway for aecopd should be evaluated from various viewpoints by comparing a group treated by the clinical pathway against a control group . such a comprehensive evaluation should provide some basis to decide how a clinical pathway should be implemented for aecopd .\nanother problem is that the present study was limited by the small number of cases of aecopd included in the present series .\nhowever , this is all the patients with aecopd admitted to this hospital during the study period .\nalthough it has been reported that prevalence of copd is similar to western countries by a general population sample study,6 health care providers still feel that aecopd is not so frequent .\nsince the copd stage before aecopd may affect the clinical pathway , the therapeutic interventions included in the clinical pathway could have been tailored to the disease severity of stable copd before aecopd . in conclusion ,\nthe rate of dropouts from the clinical pathway for aecopd was low , and most of the dropouts were hypercapnic cases that required nppv treatment .\nalthough there are many differences in health care delivery between japan and western countries , it is also important to recognize that there are many issues remaining with regard to how clinical pathways should be applied .\nnevertheless , the application of evidence - based medicine and the establishment of a standard treatment protocol based on clinical guidelines will certainly allow us to use the clinical pathway for aecopd as an effective strategy .\nwe believe that the clinical pathway for aecopd can fill the gap between the guidelines and clinical practice ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " backgroundrandomized controlled trials , evidence -

100 times stronger than csa in inhibiting the synthesis of il-2 and enhancing the synthesis of il-5 , il-13 , and ige [ 2 , 3 ] . moreover , tac increases the permeability of the intestinal mucosa and damages the intestinal barrier serving as protection from excessive antigen uptake , which may predispose to allergy development .\nit has been demonstrated that reducing the tac dose or replacing it with csa may contribute to alleviating the symptoms of allergy , reducing the concentrations of cige , sige , and eosinophils , and negativizing the spt results .\nthe currently available literature includes two reports confirming the manifestation of allergy after heart transplantation in children [ 3 , 6 ] .\nit should be mentioned that , in the present case , no allergy was observed before the procedure ( low cige and no sige in the 2 month of life ) , and the family 's medical history did not feature atopic diseases , which are known to be an important risk factor for the development of allergy per se in the offspring .\nthe signs of ige - dependent food allergy ( diarrhea , no body mass increase ) and ad appeared in the present patient within the first year after the orthotopic heart transplant performed during the patient 's 6 month of life .\nafter the start of the elimination diet , the symptoms associated with the gastrointestinal tract subsided , the skin lesions were alleviated , and the number of sige for milk , chicken egg white , and soy was reduced , which may serve as indirect evidence that the patient acquired tolerance to the listed foods .\nthe literature data indicate that post - transplant food allergy is usually polyvalent ( milk , eggs , peanuts , soy , wheat , fish ) and manifests itself from several months to over a year after transplantation , which was also the case with our patient [ 4 , 10 , 14 , 16 ] .\nnotwithstanding , the manifestation of allergy may also occur after several years [ 15 , 17 ] .\nfood allergy most often appears in the form of urticaria ( hives ) and vasomotor edemas , anaphylaxis , or , less commonly , eosinophilic gastroenteritis [ 15 , 16 ] .\nwe can assume with fair probability that the signs of food allergy and ad presented by the patient are associated with the tac treatment and the immaturity of the immune system .\nit is also known that viral diarrhea and ebv infection predispose to food allergy manifestation [ 10 , 14 ] .\nb lymphocytes infected with ebv are stimulated to synthesize ige , il-4 , and il-5 , which may induce chronic eosinophilic inflammation and promote allergy development . in our patient ,\nthe replication of the epstein - barr virus in serum was confirmed by the pcr method ( a large number of ebv copies ) .\nthe treatment - resistant orofacial lesions in the form of erythema around the mouth , diffuse edema and fissures of the median lip , gingival edema , and longitudinal creases on the mucous membrane of the mouth vestibule continue to pose a significant clinical problem .\nthe frequent recurrence of staphylococcal infections and candidiasis observed around the patient 's mouth is a side effect of the employed immunosuppression and results from the weakened functioning of the immune system .\nit is worth underscoring that high concentrations of cige have a negative impact on the process of eliminating bacteria from the skin and promote chronic pathogen colonization by inhibiting neutrophil adhesion , phagocytosis , and respiratory burst .\nas mentioned in the case study , lymphoproliferative disorders were excluded in our patient ; the persistent hypergammaglobulinemia may serve as evidence for chronic inflammation .\nsimilar orofacial lesions in small children after liver and renal transplants have been reported by other authors [ 14 , 15 , 20 ] .\nsuggest that treatment - resistant inflammatory lesions of the oral mucosa occurring after the transplantation of solid organs in neonates and small children should be considered as a separate nosological entity ( long - standing oral mucosal lesions ) .\nthese changes appear from 1 to 4 years after transplantation and may persist for years .\nthey are characterized by the presence of round nodules covering the dorsum of the tongue , which , ultimately , transform into fissures .\nother typical signs include hypertrophy of the oral mucosa ( mucosal tags ) , hyperplastic foci with fissures forming the image of  cobblestone  mucosa , erythemas around the mouth and diffuse edemas , inflammation of the mouth corners , and median lip fissures .\nexhibited vasomotor edemas , urticaria , and anaphylaxis immediately after the consumption of allergenic foods .\nit can not be excluded that the swelling of the eyelids described in the present case may have been associated with accidental consumption of food allergens .\nalthough the use of an elimination diet improves the symptoms of food allergy , it has no effect on orofacial lesions , as confirmed by observations . unfortunately , the substitution of tac with csa also failed to alleviate the abovementioned inflammatory lesions in our patient .\nit is believed that the coexistence of allergy and chronic inflammation of the vermilion border and the oral mucosa may result from immunological dysregulation .\nit has been suggested that autoantigens and the commensal bacterial flora of the oral cavity may contribute to the initiation of chronic inflammatory changes .\nan association has been found between the incidence and intensity of gingival hypertrophy and the presence and density of colonies of saccharomycetes from the candida genus . to conclude , in small children after heart transplantation who exhibit high total concentrations of ige and eosinophils , diarrhea , and skin lesions , the allergic origin of the symptoms should be excluded .\nan elimination diet , recommended for food allergy , has no impact on the chronic inflammatory lesions of the orofacial area observed after heart transplants . maintaining proper oral hygiene plays a significant role in preventing and alleviating inflammatory lesions of the periodontium and the oral cavity in transplant recipients ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " in recent years , we have been observing an increased proportion of atopic diseases in children after solid organ transplantation . \n the pathogenesis of post -

fed infants which occurs due to the defective secretion of zn into mothers milk .\nthis disorder is well distinct , clinically as well as genetically , from the other zn - related entity specified as acrodermatitis enterohepathica ( aez ; omim number 201100 ) , where the uptake of zn is the inborn error of metabolism [ 1214 ] . here\nwe describe the clinical case of an exclusively breast - fed 6 months old infant presented to our outpatient clinic suffering from zn deficiency caused by an autosomal dominant negative g87r mutation in the zinc transporter znt2 gene ( slc30a2 ) in the mother .\nin addition , as the mechanism of zn on growth and development is not well known , we focus further on its impact on growth hormone production / secretion .\nfollowing an uneventful pregnancy the baby girl ( ii.3 ) was born at term ( birth weight 3210  g , 50th centile ; birth length 49  cm , 50th centile )   ( figure 1 ) .\nhowever , at the age of 6 months the infant was presented to the outpatient clinic of dermatology in the university of bern , switzerland .\nthe clinical examination revealed an otherwise healthy , exclusively breast - fed 6 months old infant presented with a 3 weeks history of increasing skin problems , abdominal cramps , and diarrhoea with no obvious malnutrition .\nthe skin lesions involving the face in a perioral distribution ( figure 2(a ) ) , head ( figure 2(b ) ) , and in the anal area ( figure 2(c ) ) appeared like an acrodermatitis enteropathica while the analysis of serum revealed a significantly low zn level ( table 1 ) and decreased level of alkaline phosphatase .\nserum zn level in the mother was measured normal , while zn concentration in mother 's breast milk was 0.12  mg / kg , which was significantly lower than the normative values ( table 1 ) .\nin addition , while analysing length , weight , and length velocity of the infant , a stunted growth ( igf - i and igf - bp3 levels at 2.3  sds , 2.9  sds , resp . ) and a failure to thrive became obvious starting at the age of 3 months and progressed further until the age of 6 months , at the time when zn supplementation was started ( figure 3 ) . at that point\nthe infant also presented with a length that significantly dropped below the 3rd centile on the growth curve ( figure 3 ) . an oral zn supplementation therapy ( administered p.o , 4  mg / kg / day , as zinc sulphate heptahydrate ) initiated and thereafter led to disappearance of all the clinical symptoms within the next four weeks . for the genetic studies , written informed consent was obtained from both parents .\ngenomic dna was isolated from peripheral leukocytes of the affected subjects using the qiaamp blood extraction kit ( qiagen ag , basel , switzerland ) and used as a template for analysis of the znt2 gene .\nthe concentration of each sample was determined by measuring the optical density of the purified dna at 260 and 280  nm .\nthe genomic organization of human znt2 was determined from published internet data ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ ) , and each one of the 8 coding exons was amplified by pcr amplification using established primers . for pcr ,\napproximately 100  ng of genomic dna was used as template in a pcr supermix high fidelity ( invitrogen , uk ) in a total reaction volume of 50  l .\npcr was carried out in tgradient thermoblock ( biometra , germany ) under the following conditions : 33 cycles with an initial denaturation step at 94c for 2  min , thereafter 94c for 45  s , annealing at 60c ( for exons 1 ) , 55c ( for exon 2 and 4 ) , 61c ( for exon 3 ) , 59c ( for exon 5 , 6 , 7 ) , 57c ( for exons 8) for 45 s , and with an extension of 72c for 1  min .\nthe bands corresponding to each specific pcr product were purified with qiaquick pcr purification kit ( qiagen ag , basel , switzerland ) and sequenced on an abi 373 automated dna sequencing system ( applied biosystems ) .\nthe sequences were confirmed by re - pcr and resequencing from the genomic dna of both strands .\nwe identified a heterozygous g87r znt2 mutation in the mother ( i.1 ) as well as in the baby / girl ( ii.3 ) ( figures 14 ) . to know that ii.3 does carry\nthe mutation is very much of importance for her possible life as a breastfeeding mother .\nthis mutation has been previously reported and studied in most detail at the functional level . in this study as well in a previous report the authors showed that a functional inactivation of the znt2 is the underlying cause of tnzd [ 10 , 11 ] .  \nthe aim of our study , however , was to focus on the impact of length and length velocity in a zn - deficient environment .\nalthough the mechanisms are not well studied , it is well known and accepted that prolonged zn deficiency during infancy as well as childhood is not a negligible cause for stunting growth and failure to thrive [ 15 ] .   as demonstrated in figure 3 , the oral zn supplementation therapy ( administered p.o , 4  mg / kg / day , as zinc sulphate heptahydrate ) resulted after 4 months in a complete catch - up growth of the child as well as normalized the igf - i and igf - bp3 levels ( table 1 ) .\ntherefore , a sufficient zn serum concentration in this infant seems also to be of crucial importance for gh secretion and , thus , normal growth and development .   by inoue et al .\n, znt5-null mice , as the result of crossing between heterozygous mice according to mendelian expectations , were cloned and provided some in vivo data about the phenotype caused by the complete deletion of only one zinc transporter , namely , znt5 .\nznt5-null mice displayed abnormal bone development , loss of weight , and lethal , male - specific , cardiac arrhythmia .\ninterestingly , these mice presented with significantly impaired growth when compared to the wild - type animals and with a high degree of osteopenia due to systemic decrease in bone density as the results of the reduced activity of osteoblasts . although the authors did not focus on growth , it has been nicely described and depicted in this study .\nfurther , robinson et al . used the advantage of enhanced green fluorescent protein ( egfp ) , which when expressed from cell - specific promoters in transgenic animals , allows identification of specific cell types in situ and provides a fluorescent tag for their isolation and analysis , using fluorescence - activated cell sorting ( facs ) technique [ 17 , 18 ] .\ntherefore , egfp was targeted to the secretory granules of pituitary gh - producing cells in transgenic mice ( gh - egfp transgenic mouse ) [ 18 , 19 ] , followed by the facs sorting of somatotrope cells ( egfp cells ) .\nanalysis of specific gene expression patterns using microarray technique was performed , and relative expression data of all zinc transporters assessed ( table 2 ) revealed the expression of znt5 to be the strongest in somatotropes .\nhence , these data suggest high involvement of znt5 in the processes of gh storage and secretion .\nthe initial main symptoms of mild zn deficiency are growth faltering as well as anorexia .\nfurther prolonged and/or severe zinc deficiency presents with dermatitis and alopecia and is often expressed in growth impairment as well as neuropsychological alterations .\ninfants are particularly vulnerable to zn deficiency , as they require large amounts of zn for their normal growth and development . although term infants are born with an important hepatic zinc storage , adequate zinc nutrition of infants mostly depends on breast milk ( especially in the first 3 months of lactation ) or milk formula feeding , which contains an adequate amount of zn to meet the infants ' requirements\nfirst , it may be a result of deficient nutrition due to low level of zn in the breast milk or to consumption of food that is poor in zn bioavailability , or second , it is associated with distinct genetic disorders in zn metabolism [ 10 , 11 , 13 , 21 ] .\none of those genetic defects is associated with mutations of the intestinal zn - specific transporter slc39a4/zip4 [ 12 , 13 ] , which is responsible for zn absorption in the small intestine and when mutated leads to a rare , autosomal recessive disease called acrodermatitis enteropathica ( aez ) ( omim number 201100 ) .\naez manifests in impaired intestinal zn absorption ; hence , patients harbouring aez require lifelong zinc supplementation [ 14 , 22 ] . without therapy , plasma zn concentration and serum alkaline phosphatase , as well as urinary excretion of zn ,\nanother genetic defect is associated with a mutation within slc30a4/znt4 and causes a reduced zn incorporation into mother 's milk [ 11 , 21 ] .\nmice homozygous for a znt4 mutation are known as lethal milk mice ( lm / lm mouse ) producing milk , which is zn deficient ( omim number 602095 ) . as this phenotype in mice mirrors\ntnzd ( omim number 608118 ) in breast - fed infants [ 79 ] michalczyk et al .\ninvestigated whether changes in the znt4 gene are responsible for reduced zn in breast milk in human in two unrelated mothers with low zn milk levels whose babies had developed zn deficiency .\ntheir findings suggested that the lm / lm mouse is not the corresponding model for the human zn deficiency condition .\ngene knockdown of znt2 in mammary epithelial cells reduced zn secretion , suggesting a role for this transporter in zn secretion from this cell type .\nznt2 was also found to be upregulated and relocalised to vesicles after exposure of mammary epithelial cells to prolactin .\nsimilarly , mammary gland znt2 was upregulated and relocalised to the luminal membrane in lactating rats when plasma zinc increased during lactation [ 26 , 27 ] .\nheterozygous h54r and g87r mutations in znt2 were recently identified in women presenting with a zn - deficient milk [ 10 , 11 ] . as there is no impairment in zn uptake in the gut in affected babies , their infants , consequently , developed tnzd that was resolved after oral zn supplementation [ 10 , 11 ] . as previously reported by lasry et al .  \nwe identified and characterized a heterozygous g87r mutation in znt2  leading to production of zn - deficient milk in a mother originated from the philippines ; as a result , their exclusively breast - fed infants developed tnzd with low zn blood levels that resolved upon zn supplementation .\nas far as the function is concerned , lasry et al . showed that the g87r mutation is a loss of function mutation and they provided , therefore , the first evidence for the dominant inheritance of heterozygous znt2 mutations via negative dominance due to homodimer formation .\nthe growth hormone-1 ( gh-1 ) gene is mainly expressed as a major 22  kda isoform in somatotrope cells of the anterior pituitary gland . after being translated\n, gh protein passes throughout the regulated secretory pathway where it gets packed and stored in concentrated forms in secretory granules enabling a regulated release in circulation upon ghrh stimulation [ 29 , 30 ] .  \nzn is considered as the second most abundant  trace  metal in the human body which is required for numerous cellular mechanisms like dna synthesis , protein synthesis , cell growth , and division   as well as for many physiological processes like immune function   and reproduction [ 33 , 34 ] .\nhence , cellular zn homeostasis and dynamics are tightly regulated and maintained by various zn transporters responsible for transporting these high charge density ions across cellular membranes and various intracellular organelles [ 35 , 36 ] . over two decades ago\n, a high concentration of zn was reported to be localized mostly in the golgi complex and gh - containing secretory granules of rat anterior pituitary cells , suggesting in that way , an important role of zn in the regulated secretory pathway of gh . during the process of secretory granule biogenesis , self - association ( aggregation ) of a hormone destined for secretion\nfacilitates its storage in granules in fairly high amounts , and in the case of gh , it occurs in the presence of zn .  \nthe complex process of secretory granule biogenesis begins with aggregation of proteins ( hormones ) destined for secretion to form dense cores of granules composed of large insoluble aggregates . upon appropriate stimulation ,\naggregates are released into the bloodstream leading to a burst of hormone on a time scale much faster than it could be achieved from increased synthesis .  \nprotein aggregation takes place in the lumen of trans - golgi layer where specific environmental factors seem to play an important role in inducing this process .\nin fact , apart from specific ph requirements [ 39 , 40 ] , aggregation of gh apparently requires high amounts of divalent cations like zn .  \na step further towards unravelling the role of zn in storage of gh in secretory granules came with the study reporting that two zn associates per gh dimer in a cooperative fashion through binding at high - affinity residues in gh ( his18 , his21 , and glu174 ) .\nreplacement of these residues with alanine caused reductions of dimeric gh formation as demonstrated by size - exclusion chromatography and sedimentation equilibrium analysis .\nin addition , the data presented also demonstrate that zn binding to gh would enhance stability of the stored form and that zn - gh complex was more stable to denaturation when compared to monomeric gh ultimately proposing that zn - gh dimer may be the main storage form in the secretory granules .\nthe potential contribution of high - affinity zn - binding residues in gh to the pathogenic mechanisms involved in dominantly transmitted isolated gh deficiency type ii ( ighd ii ) was further studied by iliev et al . .\nthe production and extracellular secretion of wt - hgh transiently transfected in gh4c1 cells ( rat pituitary tumour cells ) were compared to that of gh mutants in which the amino acids that bind zn with high affinity were mutated to alanine in various combinations .\nwhen wt - hgh was coexpressed with any of the zn - binding gh mutants , constitutive gh secretion ( i.e. , without stimulation ) and intracellular production remained unaffected .\ninterestingly , each of the zn - binding gh mutants ( single , double , or triple mutants ) singly expressed displayed about 50% lower extracellular secretion and intracellular production when compared to the wt - hgh suggesting possible role of these residues in gh stability .  \ngh and prl are two hormones that are structurally related , and therefore it is of no surprise that they display many similarities in the process of aggregation as reported in the study mentioned above . however , alanine mutation introduced at his27 in hprl ( topologically corresponding to his18 in hgh ) resulted in h27a - prl mutant reported not to bind zn .\ninterestingly , even without the high - affinity zn binding site , h27a - prl is still able to aggregate in the presence of zn with parameters similar to aggregation of wt - prl .\nhence , these data suggest that prl and gh do not behave similarly in the presence of zn and that prl does not form dimer under the conditions that gh does , indicating that the dimer is unlikely to be the storage form of prl in secretory granules .\nzn binding to human prl and gh can occur through histidine residues ( the high - affinity binding sites ) [ 41 , 43 ] or through glutamate , aspartate , and glutamine residues ( the low - affinity binding sites ) .\nacidic ph in the trans - golgi lumen where the process of aggregation occurs leads to protonation of his residues preventing their binding to zn .\ntherefore , it is more likely that zn binding to glutamate and aspartate residues ( low - affinity binding ) of prl facilitates the formation of prl oligomers as the storage form in dense cores of secretory granules . finally , as mentioned earlier zn binding to gh through high - affinity binding sites is proven to be necessary for the formation of gh dimers , but whether this is the final storage form of gh in secretory granules still remains to be elucidated . alternatively , additional intramolecular cross - linking might occur through low - affinity zn - binding with amino acids other than histidine ( as described above for prl ) enhancing in that way gh aggregation and storage in secretory granules .\nout of all proteins synthesized in eukaryotic cells approximately one - third is targeted to the secretory pathway   and the first compartment encountered along their road towards secretion is the er . together with golgi complex ,\ner comprises the early secretory pathway , which plays the key role in regulating the folding , assembly , and transport of newly synthesized proteins and modification and trafficking during the secretory process .\nthere are estimates that between three and ten percent of all proteins in mammalian genomes bind zn , and many zinc - dependent proteins pass through the secretory pathway on their way to other compartments within the cell ( e.g. , vacuole , lysosomes ) or prior to their secretion . due to its high charge density\n, zn requires transporters to move it across the cellular membranes and in and out of each of the organelles participating in the regulated secretory pathway ( er , golgi complex , and secretory granules ) .\nmore than 20 zinc transporters identified and characterized up to date , classified into two families ( slc30a / znt and slc39a / zip ) , reflect the complexity and importance of maintaining cellular zn homeostasis and dynamics .\nthe role of znts is to reduce intracellular zn by transporting it from the cytoplasm into various intracellular organelles and by moving zn into extracellular space .\nthus the coordinated action of both is essential for the maintenance of zn homeostasis in the cytoplasm , and accumulating evidence suggests that this is also true for the secretory pathway .\nhaving discussed the importance of zn as well as their individual intracellular transporters it comes without any surprise that an adequate zn concentration in the child 's plasma is of high importance for normal growth and development [ 1 , 3 , 28 , 4749 ] ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " suboptimal dietary zinc ( zn2 + ) intake is increasingly appreciated as an important public health issue . \n zn2 + is an essential mineral , and infants are particularly vulnerable to zn2 + deficiency , as they require large amounts of zn2 + for their normal growth and development . \n although term infants are born with an important hepatic zn2 + storage , adequate zn2 + nutrition of infants mostly depends on breast milk or formula feeding , which contains an adequate amount of zn2 + to meet the infants ' requirements . \n an exclusively breast - fed 6 months old infant suffering from zn2 + deficiency caused by an autosomal dominant negative g87r mutation in the slc30a2 gene ( encoding for the zinc transporter 2 ( znt-2 ) ) in the mother is reported . \n more than 20 zinc transporters characterized up to date , classified into two families ( slc30a / znt and slc39a / zip ) , reflect the complexity and importance of maintaining cellular zn2 + homeostasis and dynamics . \n the role of znts is to reduce intracellular zn2 + by transporting it from the cytoplasm into various intracellular organelles and by moving zn2 + into extracellular space . \n zips increase intracellular zn2 + by transporting it in the opposite direction . \n thus the coordinated action of both is essential for the maintenance of zn2 + homeostasis in the cytoplasm , and accumulating evidence suggests that this is also true for the secretory pathway of growth hormone .

based mechanisms of cancer therapy resistance as well as strategies by targeting ceramide metabolism for cancer therapy sensitization .\nunder apoptotic stimuli , cells undergo programmed cell death generally through the extrinsic pathway , also called the death receptor pathway , and the intrinsic pathway , also named the mitochondrial pathway . in general , extrinsic pathways are activated by the death receptors through the interaction between their natural ligands or by inducing death receptor clusterization .\ndeath receptors belong to the tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) superfamily and interact with their ligands to form death receptor complexes , including fas ( cd95/apo1)/fas ligand ( cd95 ligand ) , tnf receptor 1 ( p55)/tnf and lymphotoxin , tramp ( wsl-1/apo3/dr3/lard)/tweak ( apo3 ligand ) , trail - r1 ( dr4)/trail ( apo2 ligand ) , and trail - r2 ( dr5/apo2/killer)/trail . upon the activation of extrinsic pathway , the intracellular death domain ( dd ) of death receptors interacts with an adaptor protein fas - associated death domain ( fadd ) directly or indirectly via the tnf receptor - associated death domain . the fadd complex interacts with a typical initial procaspase-8 to form a death - inducing signaling complex required for the activation of caspase-8 .\ncaspase-8 is able to cleave bid to form a truncated form of bid ( tbid ) and causes a reduction of mitochondrial transmembrane potential ( mtp ) followed by the release of cytochrome c , which binds to apaf-1 and promotes caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation [ 20 , 21 ] .\nin addition to the extrinsic pathway , the involvement of mitochondrial injury in apoptosis is proposed to be via an intrinsic pathway .\ngenerally , activation of proapoptotic bax and bid , the members of the bcl-2 family with proapoptotic roles , leads to its translocation to the mitochondria and disrupt the membrane integrity to induce mtp [ 2224 ] .\nin contrast , bcl-2 and bcl - xl , the members of the bcl-2 family with antiapoptotic roles , protect these effects by maintaining the mtp through the inhibition of bax or other proapoptotic factors .\ndysregulation on the balance of bcl-2/bax contributes to the progression of apoptosis of intrinsic pathway .\nstresses on the endoplasmic reticulum ( er ) , which is the site of protein synthesis , modification , and folding , can trigger an unfolded protein response ( upr ) following er stress [ 2527 ] .\ner stress can be caused by the inhibition of glycosylation , the reduction of disulfide bonds , calcium depletion from the er lumen , impairment of protein transport to the golgi , and expression of mutated proteins in the er . upr of er stress enhances protein folding and degradation within the er and downregulates protein synthesis until cells have recovered from the er stress .\nhowever , er stress may also cause apoptotic cell death by the prolonged upr and is demonstrated to be involved in several apoptotic signaling pathways .\nthe er stress - induced transcription factor c / ebp homologous protein decreases the expression of antiapoptotic bcl-2 and increases reactive oxygen species ( ros ) production to trigger cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway .\napoptosis signal - regulating kinase ( ask ) 1 , an upstream kinase of c - jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) , is activated in cells through death receptors and oxidative stress .\ncaspase-4 , a specific er stress - activated caspase with homology to murine caspase-12 , triggers apoptotic pathways , dependent or independent of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation .\nmeanwhile , the activation of caspase-2 , -3 , -7 , -8 , and -9 has also been reported in er stress - induced apoptosis [ 3032 ] .\na feedback regulation of these caspases has been proposed to be mediated by er stress - activated calcium - dependent protease calpain .\ninitially , activated calpain directly causes the activation of human caspase-4 [ 33 , 34 ] . for cell death\n, acidic organelle lysosome plays a pivotal role in apoptosis and necrosis caused by oxidative stress , tnf- , sphingosine , p53 , and staurosporine [ 35 , 36 ] .\nmechanistic studies show that destabilization of lysosomal membrane and release of lysosomal content into the cytoplasm initiate the lysosomal apoptotic pathway . in general , mitochondrial / lysosomal crosstalk is regularly involved in cell death process .\nsignaling of apoptotic stimuli , such as calcium , ros , ceramide , sphingosine , phospholipase , bax , bim , bid , and caspase causes lysosomal membrane permeabilization ( lmp ) [ 36 , 37 ] .\nafter lmp , cathepsins , the lysosomal proteases , translocate to the cytosol and trigger apoptotic and necrotic pathways through bid truncation , caspase activation , and mitochondrial damage .\noverall , it is speculated that both er stress and lysosomal and mitochondrial destabilization may contribute to the initiation stage of apoptosis .\ninducing mitochondrial pathway is the major proapoptotic actions of ceramide , meanwhile , ceramide also causes lysosomal and er dysfunction to facilitate apoptotic process .\nthe crosstalk among these organelles in ceramide - induced apoptosis varies in the context of cell types and stimulations .\nmembrane sphingolipids , regulators for cell growth , death , senescence , adhesion , migration , inflammation , angiogenesis , and intracellular trafficking , are bioactive metabolites including sphingosine , ceramide , sphingosine-1-phosphate ( s1p ) , and ceramide-1-phosphate ( c1p ) .\nceramide , a sphingolipid with sphingosine backbone , is generated from diverse pathways , including newly de novo synthesis and hydrolysis of sphingomyelin or cerebrosides [ 8 , 13 , 39 , 40 ] . for de\nnovo synthesis , ceramide is produced by palmitoyltransferase - mediated interaction of serine and palmitoyl - coa and then a series of metabolic reactions . alternatively , extracellular stimulation usually induces hydrolysis of sphingolipids and sphingomyelin by sphingomyelinase ( smase ) and cerebrosides  including galactosylceramide and glucosylceramide by cerebrosidase . for the homeostasis of sphingolipid metabolism\n, ceramide is subsequently metabolized by ceramide kinase to generate c1p and by ceramidase to generate sphingosine , which is further phosphorylated to s1p by sphingosine kinase . alternatively again\n, dephosphorylation of the metabolic derivates also occurs using specific phosphatases , such as c1p phosphatase and s1p phosphatase .\nfurthermore , ceramide can also be produced from sphingosine by ceramide synthase [ 8 , 13 ] . as summarized in figure 1\n, the dynamic regulation for ceramide generation and metabolism is critical for cellular responses to extracellular stimuli , such as death receptor - mediated ( tnf- and fas ) , chemotherapeutic agent - mediated ( etoposide , cisplatin , doxorubicin , paclitaxel , and inostamycin ) , and irradiation - mediated ( uv and -irradiation ) [ 1214 ] . for tumorigenesis , ceramide acts as a tumor - suppressor lipid , whereas s1p acts as a tumor - promoting lipid .\na variety of sphingolipid metabolic disorders has been reported because of a deregulated balance on sphingolipid metabolism .\nactivation of s1p is essential for brain and cardiac development as well as for pathogenic in autoimmunity , cancer , and cardiovascular disease .\nceramide , c1p , and s1p are able to facilitate activation of proinflammatory transcription factors in different cell types to induce overexpression of proinflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox2 ) and prostaglandins .\nadditionally , cox2 inhibitor celecoxib has been reported to induce apoptosis via activating ceramide de novo synthesis .\nderegulated ceramide facilitates the progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer 's disease , parkinson 's disease , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , and other neurological disorders that are characterized by the gradual loss of specific populations of neurons through the induction of neuronal cell apoptosis [ 7 , 43 ] .\nmany apoptotic stimuli have been found to increase the levels of intracellular ceramide [ 1214 ] .\nthe role of ceramide had been speculated to be proapoptotic based on the observation that ceramide generation precedes the onset of apoptotic signaling , and exogenous treatment with ceramide induces cell apoptosis .  \nfigure 2 reveals the generation of ceramide in an apoptotic cell , typically with dna fragmentation , under hyperglycemia treatment as detected by immunostaining using a monoclonal igm against cemaride ( clone mid 15b4 ) .\nhowever , the causal relationships between ceramide generation and apoptosis had been in controversy for a while [ 4648 ] .\nthe advances in ceramide detecting methods and the discoveries of enzyme inhibitors to block ceramide synthesis or increase ceramide accumulation further identified that some ceramide - generating stimuli induce apoptosis in ceramide - dependent manner .\nceramide is important mediator in both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis [ 6 , 7 , 12 ] .\nendogenous ceramide generation and its roles in apoptotic signaling have been demonstrated in cd95- and tnf--treated conditions . in these cells ,\nacidic smase mediates hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to generate ceramide and inhibition of acidic smase effectively blocks cell death [ 5052 ] .\nin addition to acidic smase , tnf- activates neutral smase through fan ( factor associated with neutral smase activation ) to induced apoptosis .\nintrinsic apoptotic stimuli such as hypoxia , nutrient deprivation , radiation , heat , cellular stress , and cytotoxic drugs also increase endogenous ceramide levels through multiple mechanisms involving not only smase but also ceramide synthase . in general , increased ceramide causes activation of various protein kinases and phosphatases , cascade activation of caspases , dysfunction of multiple organelles , and leads to apoptosis .\nceramide is structurally composed of a fatty acyl moiety bound to an amino alcoholic chain which varies in length from 2~28 carbons .\nfirstly identified the proapoptotic role of ceramide in vitro by using c2-ceramide ( microm ) , a synthetic cell - permeable ceramide analog n - acetylsphingosine .\ntypically , c2-ceramide , but not dihydroceramide , induces internucleosomal dna fragmentation , a characteristic for cell apoptosis .\nafter that , ceramide acts as a lipid second messenger as reported in a number of researches of apoptotic signaling pathways [ 57 , 58 ] . in cancer cells , taking leukemia for instance , exogenous treatment of c2- and c6-ceramide induced apoptosis in chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) cell line k562 [ 59 , 60 ] .\nc6-ceramide promotes apoptosis in cml - derived k562 cells by a mechanism involving caspase-8 and jnk .\nnanoliposomal delivery of exogenous ceramide ( c6-ceramide ) inhibit nk - lgl leukemia in a rat model and the antiproliferative effect of ceramide is through downregulation of antiapoptotic protein survivin . whether exogenous ceramide mimic intracellular physical actions of endogenous ceramide\nhowever , it is of note that treatment of cells with exogenous ceramide ( at concentration below 20 microm to 2~10  10  cells  ml ) resembles many cellular response induced by ceramide - generating stimuli .\nmeanwhile , several interesting findings provide insight that the biologic functions of ceramide may vary by its length .\ndifferential expression of c16- ( high ) and c18-ceramide ( low ) in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( hnsccs ) suggests the c18-ceramide play proapoptotic role but not c16-ceramide [ 6365 ] .\nknockdown of c16-ceramide synthase ( ceramide synthase 6 ; cers6 ) induces er stress and apoptosis in vitro . the growth of hnsccs xenograft is promoted by overexpression of cers6 but suppressed by overexpression of cers1 ( c18-ceramide synthase ) .\nearly evidence that bcl-2 prevents ceramide - induced apoptosis [ 56 , 67 ] demonstrates exogenous ceramide initiates mitochondrial apoptosis . in cell - free system , c2-ceramide induces ros generation and inhibits mitochondrial electron transfer in isolated mitochondria [ 6870 ] .\nc2- or c16-ceramide causes increase of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability which allows cytochrome c release [ 71 , 72 ] .\nceramide can be generated in mitochondria through hydrolysis or de novo synthesis [ 7375 ] .\nboth mitochondrial - overexpressed sphingomyelinase and tnf- stimulation leads to mitochondrial ceramide accumulation , bax translocation , cytochrome c release , and apoptosis [ 73 , 76 ] .\nc2- or c6-ceramide also triggers mitochondrial apoptosis in multiple cell lines [ 7780 ] . in general , either exogenous ceramides or ceramide - generating death stimuli cause mitochondrial dysfunction , executor caspases activation , and apoptosis . compared with the field of mitochondrial apoptosis , much less studies address the role of er in ceramide - induced apoptotic signaling .\nin addition to protein synthesis , ceramide is also de novo synthesized in the er and transfer to golgi apparatus by ceramide transport protein cert [ 2 , 3 , 81 ] .\nthe hypothesis that perturbation of ceramide level in er might cause er stress is deducible but needs more evidence .\nknockdown of c16-ceramide synthase ( cers6 ) or c24-ceramide synthase ( cers2 ) induces er stress [ 66 , 82 ] . in glioma cells ,\ntetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) induces apoptosis through de novo synthesized ceramide - mediated p8 upregulation , which further trigger er stress ( induction of atf4 and chop ) .\ncombination of histone deacetylase inhibitor vorinostat and multikinase inhibitor sorafenib induces de novo synthesized and acidic smase hydrolyzed ceramide to upregulate cd95 to trigger er stress ( activation of perk ) .\ncert is identified to influence sensitivity of different cancer cell types to chemotherapeutic agents in a sirna - based screening .\ndownregulation of cert sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs and induces er stress [ 85 , 86 ] .\nour previous report showed c2-ceramide and etoposide induce er stress - related proteins bip , chop , caspase-4 , and perk activation .\nrequirement of ask1 and jnk signaling is reported in both ceramide- and er stress - induced apoptosis [ 28 , 29 , 87 , 88 ] .\ntaken together , these findings suggest that ceramide induces er stress ; however , more investigations are needed to dissect the causal relationships and regulatory mechanisms between er stress and ceramide - induced apoptosis .\nin addition , free fatty acid ( ffa ) has been reported to induce pathological er stress and lead to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance , obesity , steatosis , diabetes , and atherosclerosis [ 8991 ] .\nthe role of ceramide in insulin resistance has also been reported [ 92 , 93 ] .\nstudies showed ffa activates ceramide de novo synthesis in islet  cells to induce apoptosis   and in astrocytes to increase a protein expression and tau protein hyperphosphorylation .\nhowever , another report demonstrated a ceramide - independent way of ffa to induce er stress in liver cells .\nmore evidence is needed to better understand the regulation of ceramide in ffa - induced er stress and downstream biological effects .\nthe mechanism by which ceramide triggers lysosomal apoptosis involves acid sphingomyelinase and cathepsin d [ 9799 ] .\nceramide generated by acid smase can directly interact with cathepsin d and mediate its activation [ 99101 ] . in response to tnf- stimulation , lysosomal acid smase mediates ceramide generation to activate cathepsin d and downstream apoptotic signaling such bid truncation and mitochondrial dysfunction .\nsimilar pathway has been recently reported in treatment of glioma cells with chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine .\nexogenous treatment with c2-ceramide triggers this pathway in 10i hybridoma and a549 lung adenocarcinoma cells , however ; different mechanism might exist because inhibiting acid smase did not reduce lmp and apoptosis ( huang et al .\n, unpublished data ) . moreover , one study reported ffa - induced lmp and apoptosis in liver cells independently of ceramide de novo synthesis .\nconcerning the findings of ffa - induced er stress , the signaling pathways of ffa - induced apoptosis might have ceramide - dependent and -independent routes in triggering er and lysosome dysfunction . in summary as shown in figure 3 , ceramide mediates dysfunction of multiple intracellular organelles followed by apoptosis .\nmore investigations are needed to fully understand the cell type- and stimulus - dependent mechanisms of how ceramide causes organelles dysfunction and the crosstalk among these organelles .\ncancer cells resist therapy in multiple mechanisms including escape from therapy - induced apoptosis [ 122124 ] . since the proapoptotic role of ceramide in cellular regulation is well established , either endogenous or exogenous ceramide contributes to the suppression of cancer progression [ 8 , 14 , 58 ] . on the other hand\n, cancer cells also gain survival advantages against therapy by impairing sphingolipids metabolism to reduce proapoptotic ceramide generation and accumulation [ 8 , 9 , 11 , 125 ] .\nmore than 30 enzymes are identified to regulate intracellular ceramide . among them , glucosylceramide synthase , ceramidase , and sphingosine kinase are recently found to be targets for cancer cells to avoid killing of treatment .\nhere we summarized the findings about their roles in regulation of cancer therapy resistance ( also listed in table 1 ) .  \nrelationships between gcs and chemoresistance have been reported in various kinds of cancer cells and addressed in breast cancer most completely . in studies to compare the lipid compounds of drug - sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines , glucosylceramides accumulation are found in drug - sensitive cells [ 126129 ] .\nreciprocally , genetic silencing and pharmacological inhibition of gcs sensitizes drug - resistant cells to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs , such as adriamycin , vinca alkaloids , doxorubicin , etoposide , and paclitaxel [ 103 , 104 , 107 , 130 ] .\na recent in vivo study reported a mixed - backbone oligonucleotide against gcs sensitizes xenograft of multidrug - resistant breast cancer cell to doxorubicin .\ngcs links multidrug resistance by multiple mechanisms , including reduced concentration of c18-ceramide , increased glycosphingolipids accumulation , and mdr gene upregulation through csrc and -catenin [ 104 , 107109 , 130 ] .\nupregulated mdr gene in turn encodes p - glycoprotein ( p - gp ) , a drug efflux pump which induces multidrug resistance ( mdr ) in cancers [ 131133 ] .\none study reported that gcs - deficient and -ectopic expressed murine melanoma cells show no difference in the sensitivity to doxorubicin , vinblastine , paclitaxel , cytosine arabinoside , or short - chain ceramide analogs .\nanother study showed that combining gcs inhibitor enhances doxorubicin - induced ceramide accumulation and apoptosis in hepatoma cells by a p - gp - independent manner .\nthese findings suggested that regulation of gcs in chemoresistance depends on cell type and might act through different mechanism . besides in breast cancer cells ,\noverexpression of gcs is also found in multidrug - resistant leukemia , melanoma , colon cancer , and head and neck epidermoid carcinoma .\nfor example , in acute myeloid leukemia ( aml ) , the ceramide levels are lower and the activities of gcs and sphingomyelin synthase are higher than in chemosensitive patients .\nthe role of gcs is further confirmed in cell model when overexpression of gcs raised the resistance of hl-60 to doxorubicin - induced apoptosis . in cml ,\ndrug - resistant k562 cells also express higher level of gcs . pharmacological inhibition using pdmp or genetic silencing of gcs sensitizes drug - resistant k562 cells to adriamycin .\ngcs and glycosphingolipids are also speculated to involve immune escape and metastasis in cancer [ 135 , 136 ] .\noverexpression of gcs and high secretion of glycosphingolipids might prevent cancer cell from immune attack by t cells and antibodies .\npreincubation with gcs inhibitor pdmp reduced the metastatic ability of lewis lung carcinoma 3ll cells injected in mice .\nhowever , more investigations are needed .   according to the maximal enzymatic activity in acidic , neutral , and alkaline environment ,\nceramidases are divided into acid , neutral , and alkaline ceramidases . due to its ability to breakdown ceramide to regulate sphingosine and s1p levels ,\nectopic expression of acid ceramidase in prostate cancer cell line du145 shows elevated resistance to doxorubicin- , cisplatin- , etoposide- , gemcitabine- or c6-ceramide - induced apoptosis , while silence of acid ceramidase lowers the resistance to those drugs .\nacid ceramidase inhibitor b13 induces apoptosis in prostate cancer cell line and xenograft [ 139 , 140 ] . in colon carcinomas ,\nceramide levels are lower than healthy tissue   and treatment with exogenous ceramide or ceramidase inhibitor b13 induces apoptosis [ 141 , 142 ] .\nacid ceramidase overexpression prevents fibrosarcoma cell line l929 from tnf--induced apoptosis and treatment of exogenous ceramide or acid ceramidase inhibitor n - oleoylethanolamine overcomes this tnf- resistance .\noverexpression of neutral ceramidase prevents primary hepatocytes from tnf--induced apoptosis in vitro and inhibits d - galactosamine plus tnf--induced liver injury in vivo .\nanother report showed high ectopic expression of alkaline ceramidase 2 in cervical cancer cell line hela leads to growth arrest due to sphingosine accumulation and low ectopic expression of alkaline ceramidase promote cell proliferation due to s1p production .\na recent study demonstrated silence of alkaline ceramidase 3 inhibits not only cell proliferation but also serum deprivation - induced apoptosis .\nmore evidence is needed to fully understand the regulation of neutral and alkaline ceramidases on the development of therapy resistance in cancer cells .  \nactivation of sphk results in the generation of s1p to facilitate survival and therapy resistance in cancer cells .\nample evidence reveals the oncogenic role of sphk1 ; however , the isoform sphk2 seems to possess not only overlapping role with sphk1 in promoting tumor development but also opposite role in inducing apoptosis [ 147 , 148 ] .\ntherefore , a recent study has developed a new sphk2 specific inhibitor   which might be used to further dissect the biological functions between the two isoforms .\noverexpression of sphk1 promotes the development erythroleukemia . in cml , which is caused by potent oncogenic protein bcr - abl ,\nthe activity of sphingosine kinase-1 ( sphk1 ) is elevated by bcr - abl to increase expression of antiapoptotic protein mcl-1   and bcr - abl inhibitor imatinib - induced apoptosis through inhibiting sphk1 .\nin myelodysplastic syndromes and acute leukemia , increased gene expression of sphk1 leads to doxorubicin resistance which in reverse can be abrogated by sphk1 sirna [ 117 , 153 ] .\nin solid tumors , sphk1 is required in the oncogenic signaling of vesicular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , and ras [ 154156 ] .\noverexpression of sphk1 has been identified in mrna screening or immunohistochemistry staining in multiple cancer cells derived from breast , colon , lung , ovary , stomach , uterus , kidney , and rectum [ 157159 ] . in human ovarian cancer cells ,\nprostate cancer cell line pc3 resistant to chemotherapeutic drug camptothecin is found to highly express sphk1 .\nhigher activity of sphk1 and sphk2 in oxaliplatin - resistant colon cancer cell line rko and knockdown of either sphk1 or sphk2 abrogates rko cells oxaliplatin resistance .\none report showed hypoxia upregulates sphk2 protein expression as well as enzymatic activity to resist chemotherapeutic drugs - induced cell death in lung cancer cell line a549 .  \nacid smase - difficient ms1418 lymphoblasts from patients with niemann - pick disease show resistance to uva and irradiation [ 161 , 162 ] .\nan in vivo study also demonstrates mouse deficient in acid smase showed resistance to irradiation - induced apoptosis .\nreciprocally , overexpression of acid smase sensitizes glioma cells to gemcitabine and doxorubicin . in cancer cells ,\nmany apoptotic stresses such as uv , irradiation , doxorubicin , cisplatin , trail , and cd95 activates acid smase to induce apoptosis [ 163 , 164 ] .\nactivated acid smase translocates to plasma membrane and increases ceramide to form ceramide - rich platforms ( crps ) which are required in signal transduction and apoptosis [ 165 , 166 ] .\none report suggested that the low fluidity of plasma membrane may be associated with cisplatin resistance .\nhowever , whether cancer cells downregulate acid smase to reduce crps formation and plasma membrane fluidity to achieve drug resistance remains unclear .\nopposite to the proapoptotic role of ceramide , s1p inhibits apoptosis by preventing release of mitochondrial cytotoxic effectors cytochrome c and smac / diablo in several acute human leukemia cell lines .\nincreasing s1p by downregulation of s1p lyase was found to alter s1p / ceramide rheostat to favor cell survival in colon cancer and ectopic expression of s1p lyase induces apoptosis via p53 and p38 mapk .\nexperimentally , using human embryonic kidney cells hek293 , ectopic expression of s1p lyase decreases cell viability and enhances ceramide generation and stress - induced apoptosis , meanwhile , addition of s1p reverses stress - induced apoptosis .\noverexpression of s1p lyase in hek293 and a549 cells showed higher sensitivity to several chemotherapeutic drugs including cisplatin , carboplatin , and doxorubicin .\nin addition , increased expression of ceramide transport protein cert is found in residual tumor following paclitaxel treatment of ovarian cancer .\nloss of function of cert leads to ceramide accumulation in er and sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy [ 85 , 171 ] .\nbased on the knowledge that cancer cells develop resistance to therapy by arming themselves with the abilities to avoid generation / accumulation of intracellular proapoptotic ceramide , targeting ceramide metabolic pathways might be potential strategy to improve the response to cancer therapy .\nthis strategy might itself be an alternative therapeutic option or in combination with present cancer therapies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and sensitivity . many chemotherapeutic drugs , such as daunorubicin , etoposide , camptothecin , fludarabine , and gemcitabine , have been known to induce ceramide de novo synthesis to mediate cytotoxic effects .\naccordingly , it is conceivable that alteration of ceramide metabolism can significantly affect sensitivity of chemotherapy .\ngcs inhibition can restore sensitivity of drug - resistant cancer cells to multiple chemotherapeutic drugs [ 104 , 106 , 107 ] .\nthe major cause of chemoresistance is therapeutic stress - induced p - gp overexpression which results in mdr .\na set of mdr modulators , which bind and interfere with drug efflux , are used in combination of chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance efficacy .\nmdr modulators sensitize drug - resistant cancer cells to chemotherapy through elevating ceramide levels by activating ceramide synthase or inhibiting gcs [ 173176 ] .\ncombination of mdr modulators and gcs inhibitor synergistically induce cytotoxicity in various human solid tumor cell lines , including neuroblastoma and melanoma , prostate , lung , colon , breast , and pancreatic cancers .\nsphk1 inhibitor by itself overcomes mdr - associated chemoresistance in aml and cml cell lines and patient samples and gemcitabine - resistant pancreatic cancer cells [ 115 , 116 , 178 ] .\ndownregulation of sphk1 or sphk2 enhances sensitivity to doxorubicin in breast cancer cell mcf-7 [ 179 , 180 ] .\none of the sphingolipid breakdown products , sphingosine , by itself induces apoptosis in adriamycin - resistant epidermoid carcinoma cells .\noverexpression of alkaline ceramidase 2 but not alkaline ceramidase 1 or 3 enhances the cytotoxicity of 4-hpr in hela cells .\na recent report demonstrated combining exogenous c6-ceramide sensitizes multiple cancer cell lines to doxorubicin or etoposide .\ndefective ceramide metabolism causes resistance to radiation in aml and burkitt 's lymphoma cells [ 184 , 185 ] .\nthe defect - inducing proteins are needed to be identified for therapeutic target to improve radiosensitivity .\ncombining fumonisin b1 ( inhibitor of ceramide synthase ) restore the sensitivity of radioresistant m4be to radiation . in glioma cells , combining either acid ceramidase inhibitor n - oleoylethanolamine or gcs inhibitor pdmp accelerates radiation - induced apoptosis [ 187 , 188 ] . for overcoming resistance to cancer target therapy and gene therapy ,\nthe bcr - abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib is the standard target therapy of cml .\nimatinib induces apoptosis in k562 cells via the generation of c18-ceramide , but this is not observed in imatinib - resistant cells .\noverexpression of cers1 or silence of sphk1 enhances imatinib - induced apoptosis in imatinib - resistant cells .\nmoreover , in our unpublished data , bcr - abl mutation - based imatinib resistance was abrogated by combining ceramide accumulating agents such as gcs inhibitor or ceramidase inhibitor , though in a not well - defined mechanism .\nbesides combinational treatment , c6-ceramide and sphk1 inhibitor independently induce apoptosis in imatinib - resistant cml cell lines kbm5 and lama84s , respectively [ 59 , 152 ] .\nsorafenib ( bay 43 - 9006 ) is a nonspecific inhibitor of raf / mek / erk pathway and receptor tyrosine kinase .\ncombining sorafenib with either sphk2 or sphk1/2 inhibitor provides enhanced growth inhibition of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and kidney carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo . as prostate cancer ,\nhnsccs are also showed overexpression of acid ceramidase , therefore , acid ceramidase inhibitor is used to increase the cytotoxicity of adenovirus - delivered fasl in hnsccs .  \nin addition to overcome cancer therapy resistance , targeting ceramide pathway might be a strategy to advance current conventional therapies into novel regimen on different cancer types .\ncombining sorafenib with nanoliposomal ceramide enhances sensitivity to sorafenib in another cancer cell types including melanoma and breast cancer .\nthough , it is challenging to optimize solutions for overcoming resistance due to the complexity of sphingolipids metabolic network . by accumulating knowledge about how cancer cells escape from apoptotic stimuli and the discovery of potent and safe inhibitors\n, targeting ceramide metabolic pathways still provides opportunities for more feasible and more efficacious cancer therapy ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " apoptosis , also called programmed cell death , is physiologically and pathologically involved in cellular homeostasis . \n escape of apoptotic signaling is a critical strategy commonly used for cancer tumorigenesis . \n ceramide , a derivative of sphingolipid breakdown products , acts as second messenger for multiple extracellular stimuli including growth factors , chemical agents , and environmental stresses , such as hypoxia , and heat stress as well as irradiation . also , ceramide acts as tumor - suppressor lipid because a variety of stress stimuli cause apoptosis by increasing intracellular ceramide to initiate apoptotic signaling . \n defects on ceramide generation and sphingolipid metabolism are developed for cancer cell survival and cancer therapy resistance . \n alternatively , targeting ceramide metabolism to correct these defects might provide opportunities to overcome cancer therapy resistance .

matched controls ) , the composition of the battery , and the norms .\nthe criteria concerning preserved or relatively preserved activities of daily living also permit considerable variability as to where the line is drawn by different clinicians\n. how complex must an impaired instrumental activity of daily living be before the label mci is applied ?\nfor that matter , how simple should the task be before the affected person is said to convert to alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) ?\ndifferences in an individual 's performance of life 's tasks create both patient and clinician variability in perceptions as well as cross - cultural challenges in multinational studies ( gaines a , whitehouse pj , unpublished data ) .\nthe existence of a continuum of cognitive changes is illustrated by mci being bounded on one side by ad and on the other by labels such as age - associated memory impairment ( aami ) or age - related cognitive decline .\nthe emergence of aami was also closely linked to attempts to develop medicines to treat this condition .\nthe criteria for applying this label included demonstrating test performance one standard deviation below younger - age controls , thus creating a large number of older individuals who could be labeled with aami . yet\nwhether mci is normal or not is at the heart of the conceptual and practical ambiguities associated with this concept .\nclinicians know logically that there is a time in the life course of a patient , who will eventually be diagnosed as having ad , when the symptoms are present , but not sufficiently severe to warrant the label dementia .\nany progressive medical condition must have a phase in which the symptoms are emerging , but not of sufficient intensity to warrant a disease label . in medicine , increasing attention is being paid to so - called preclinical states , such as in hypertension , depression , and parkinson 's disease .\nthus , it is not at all surprising that different variants of mci have been identified , including amnestic mci , mci with symptoms in several different cognitive domains , and mci with focal symptoms in an intellectual area other than memory .\nthe mci associated with frontal lobe dementia and vascular dementia would more likely be predicted to be nonamnestic .\nthe symptoms in mci are mild and perhaps more variable than in dementia ; therefore , it is not surprising that the outcomes of longitudinal follow - up studies and drug studies might also be more variable .\nthe logically complete set of outcomes for a patient with mci includes no change over time , further deterioration or even improvement .\nall these outcomes can be demonstrated in epidemiological studies when patients are followed for several years .\nthere are , however , some people who improve , at least for a period of time , suggesting either a benign course to their medical condition or a mislabeling of the individual in the first place , perhaps due to a bad testing day or mild depression . if one accepts the 15% annual conversion rate , one also has to ask what happens over a more extended period of time , such as that usually associated with epidemiological studies . at 15% a year , most people would have been expected to convert to ad within 10 years .\nthis point returns us to the issue of mci as an arbitrary label on the continuum of cognitive aging and raises the unresolved question of whether all human beings would develop ad if they lived long enough .\nmost studies of those in their 80s , 90s , and beyond suggest that the incidence of ad continues to increase with age .\nthus , the major conceptual challenge to the further development of drugs to treat mci is the ambiguity around definition and the relationship to normal aging .\nother challenges also exist in the development of trial designs to demonstrate the effectiveness and safety of drugs .\nmost studies are classified as either trials to demonstrate symptomatic benefit or trials to demonstrate disease modification .\nmost of the interest in mci surfaced because of the desire to develop medications to prevent ad . in order to conduct a primary prevention protocol\n, one needs to enter into the study individuals who do not currently suffer from dementia .\none of the easiest ways to enrich the sample in a prevention study is to include people who already suffer from minor degrees of cognitive difficulties , as they are more likely to proceed to full dementia .\nof course , this begs the question as to whether this is primary prevention , or really secondary prevention in which the enrolled individuals were already suffering from a dementia at an early stage and the observed deterioration was the further progression of the already existing disease condition .\nthe problem with conducting either primary or secondary prevention studies is that there are no agreedupon designs .\nsurvival analysis as promoted by the national institute of aging 's alzheimer 's disease cooperative study in their studies of vitamin e , for example , can not clearly differentiate a prolonged symptomatic benefit from a disease - modifying or neuroprotective effect .\nthe staggered - start , staggered - stop design , elaborated most clearly by leber , has been used in a few studies .\nhowever , it has been difficult for regulators to interpret the complex slope changes necessary to make the claim that a drug is disease - modifying .\nalthough considerable effort has been placed in developing biological markers , particularly neuroimaging , no test can currently replace a clinical diagnostic process for mci .\nregulatory bodies will most likely not consider surrogate markers such as hippocampal atrophy unless they are clearly linked to clinical improvement .\nthus , from a regulatory perspective , we are puzzled to know what designs to use to demonstrate a disease - modifying process that prevents the conversion of mci to ad .\nattempts have also been made to demonstrate that medications provide symptomatic benefit for people with mci .\nsuch studies have been designed in a fashion parallel to those in ad , using outcome measures tailored to persons with less cognitive impairment . here\n, the conceptual challenges are less evident in developing the trial designs , but the practical implications of such studies are perhaps less clear . even if such studies show positive effects , what are the functional benefits to individuals and the pharmacoeconomic impacts on societies ? another area of conceptual and practical confusion that permeates\nthe study of people with mild degrees of cognitive impairment is the overlap with the emerging field of cognitive enhancement . at what point on\nthe continuum of cognitive aging is a drug not treating a disease , but rather enhancing a person 's normal ability to function intellectually .\nour pilot study of the use of donepezil in 53-year - old pilots flying in flight simulators suggests that cholinergic drugs may benefit individuals in their middle years who are performing complex cognitive tasks in society .\nstudies of the biology of brain aging , particularly changes in neurotransmitter systems , support the idea that persons with ad and mci lie on the continuum of neuronal alterations that begin perhaps quite early in life .\na related conceptual and practical problem in developing drugs to treat mci is the overlap between western scientific allopathic medicine and so - called complementary and alternative medicine ( whitehouse pj , juengst e , unpublished data ) .\nmany individuals take herbal and nutraceutical products to try to improve their memories or slow the progression of age - related cognitive deterioration .\nsuch therapies to treat brain aging overlap with those designed to slow the aging process itself .\npractically , this means that decisions must be made about whether to enroll individuals in studies who are taking such products ( and at what doses ) .\nconceptually , and from a regulatory perspective , it raises issues of what products are to be regulated by the food and drug administration ( fda ) and other drug regulatory bodies or monitored through other means or by no means at all . in both the usa and europe , there is increasing concern about the lack of oversight of such complementary and alternative medicines . yet , as we have seen\nvitamin e and ginkgo are examples of biological products that have been sold as essentially unregulated products , but that are also being studied scientifically .\na final major area of challenge to the development of more effective drugs from mci is ethics .\ngiven current science and resources , what would a drug profile look like that cured or prevented ad ?\nwhat are the implications of such a term for the individual labeled with it and for their partner and potential caregiver ( corner l , bond j , unpublished data ) ?\nif i have a label of mci , does that mean that i do not have ad , that i have a mild form of ad or another dementia , or that i may or will eventually get dementia ? moreover , we already noted that some persons with the label mci improve .\nthe implications of the term mci for an individual patient and clinician are closely linked to the fear of ad itself . perhaps in our enthusiasm for creating new medications , we have also intensified the terror that people feel about the possibility of suffering from dementia .\nperhaps the greatest ethical issue facing the development of drugs for cognitive impairment has to do with conflict of interest between researchers , physicians , and the drug industry .\none of the lessons of the introduction of drugs to treat erectile dysfunction is that the line between disease and normality is thin .\nmoreover , the ability to enhance cognition already motivates many people to take complementary and alternative medical products .\nthe concern about the use of serotonin reuptake blockers to treat depression in childhood is but one example .\na major challenge to biological psychiatry , but also to neurology , is maintaining the trust of our research participants and patients .\none important issue that surfaced around the treatment of depression is the suppression of negative trials .\nwe need to ensure that trials in dementia are entered into an international database and that the trial results made available to the scientific community or that research subjects are appropriately compensated .\nacademic experts for hire as authors of papers in which their contributions are limited is another example of a major problem .\nthe pharmaceutical industry is amazingly effective at not only selling their drugs , but also at influencing the very way we think about health .\nthe amount of money put into drug treatments limits our incentive to think about alternative ways of addressing social problems due to various age -

related cognitive impairment would have implications for ad as well . despite the work in genetics and neuroimaging\n, we are having a harder time differentiating the various types of dementia from each other .\nthis is most likely explained by the fact that the process of brain aging affects individuals in many different ways and our attempts to assign dementias into discrete categories are failing because of the overlap in biologies at work in our brain .\nneuronal loss occurs in multiple different systems to different degrees creating a wide spectrum of cognitive , affective , and motor symptoms .\nas i have suggested previously , it may be possible to treat cognitive impairment as a nonspecific symptom rather than a feature of different discrete conditions .\nthe biological substrate for such a claim is that overall loss occurs continuously in various brain nuclei as we age .\nfor example , loss of cells in the cholinergic basal forebrain occurs in a variety of dementias and with normal aging .\ncholinesterase inhibitors appear to work , albeit in modest ways , in a variety of dementias characterized by cholinergic pathology , including not only ad , but also parkinson 's disease , vascular dementia , and other overlapping conditions .\npsychosis , which may be considered a discrete category , exists in a variety of conditions ; agitation occurs on a continuum .\ndrugs to treat agitation are being developed and submitted for approval based on finding positive effects in three or more conditions , like dementia and mental retardation .\ncould we consider submitting a portfolio of results for a drug to treat cognitive impairment in several conditions and get a label for a general indication ?\nsuch an approach would not only avoid the problems of nosology in the field of dementia , which are only increasing , but allow the use of these medications to treat mild degrees of symptoms as well as more profound cognitive deficits . such an approach would greatly expand the market for potential therapies .\nthe boundaries between what is a disease and what is normality would grow even more unclear with an approach that labels cognitive impairment on a continuum .\nthe costs of drugs to our health care system would likely increase . as an advocate for the importance of pharmacoeconomic studies , especially studies of quality of life\n, i would urge that we stress the importance of such cost - utility approaches even in the current regulatory and reimbursement environment , and even if that would increase the size of the potential market . a focus on drug treatment for cognitive impairment\nfirst , we are constantly focusing on what is wrong with our cognition as we age .\nmore emphasis on cognitive vitality and the potential for older people to further develop cognitively and gain wisdom would be helpful in society .\nmoreover , a focus on drugs makes us think that the only answers to the challenges of cognitive aging lie in medicine and biology .\nclearly , there are many ways to prevent the deterioration that can occur in cognitive abilities as we age , besides waiting for a magic bullet . developing a sense of purpose , engaging in civic activities , and taking responsibility for one 's personal legacy are all activities that can contribute to a sense of cognitive vitality , even in persons who suffer from mci and ad ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the development of the concept of mild cognitive impairment ( mci ) and its practical application have been intimately tied to attempts to produce therapeutic agents . understanding the regulatory environment and determining the way in which it can be influenced are critical to the development of drugs and their eventual approval . in this article , we review some of the current challenges surrounding the concept of mci relevant to drug development , summarize activities in various regions of the world , and conclude with some suggested next steps and an alternative framing for approving drugs for mci and related conditions .

16% had recurrence with a noninvasive implant , whereas 64% had recurrence with an invasive implant ( 18 ) .\nconsidering the poor prognosis of bot with invasive peritoneal implants , it seems logical to propose conservative treatment only in patients with bot who do not have invasive implants . at present\nhowever , it is not yet possible to provide guidelines for coh - ivf in patients with advanced stage bot despite successful pregnancy outcomes ( 11 - 13 , 19 ) . in our study\none patient with stage iiic disease , without invasive peritoneal implant , had conservative treatment and underwent coh - ivf subsequently that resulted in a successful pregnancy and delivery .\nit seems that the number of coh - ivf cycles should be limited in patients with advanced stage bot because rapid progression to invasive ovarian cancer , after a successful delivery with the first ivf cycle has been reported ( 20 ) .\nalthough the pathogenic mechanisms for tumor progression remain unknown , it may be related to hormonal influences ( 9 ) .\nestrogen receptor expression was recently demonstrated in bot , and high serum e2 levels during coh - ivf may have a role in tumor promotion ( 10 ) .\nafter conservative treatment of bot the recurrence rate is estimated to be 0 - 20% ( 21 ) .\nthere is no significant difference in survival rates between conservative and radical treatment ( 22 , 23 ) .\nbeiner et al . reported a 29% recurrence rate in an ivf treatment group that was not significantly different from the 19% recurrence in the non - ivf group ( 16 ) .\nall recurrences had a histology identical to the primary diagnosis ; they were conservatively treated without evidence of recurrence at the last follow - up ( 11 ) . in our study , no recurrence of bot was detected after coh - ivf ; this is a lower recurrence rate than reported in patients who underwent conservative treatment without subsequent fertility treatment .\nalthough the perod of 29.6 ( 14 - 61 ) months is not a long follow - up period , our results suggest that coh - ivf may not affect recurrence of bot , and that pregnancy per se has no effect on the course of bot . in conclusion\n, the current study suggests that ivf may be considered for infertile patients after conservative treatment for early stage bot . for patients with advanced stage bot ,\nlarger clinical trials with longer follow - up are necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of coh - ivf .\nall patients should be informed of the potential risks associated with ovarian hyperstimulation , and close follow - up is necessary after coh - ivf ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " to evaluate the outcomes of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation ( coh)-in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) such as clinical pregnancy rate ( cpr ) , implantation rate ( ir ) and live birth rate ( lbr ) for infertile patients with borderline ovarian tumor ( bot ) after conservative treatment , 10 ivf cycles in five patients from january 1999 to july 2005 were analyzed . at the time of diagnosis with bot , the mean age of patients was 30.0 yr ( range , 22 - 40 ) . for 8 cycles out of 10 attempted ivf cycles , except for 2 cancellation cycles , the mean number of oocytes retrieved was 5.6 ( range , 2 - 16 ) with a mean fertilization rate of 74.4% . \n the cpr , ir , and lbr were 50.0% ( 4/8 cycles ) , 31.6% ( 6/19 ) and 50.0% ( 4/8 cycles ) respectively . \n the mean follow - up period after coh - ivf initiation was 29.6 ( range , 14 - 61 ) months . \n a gynecological oncologist followed all patients every 3 months during the first year and every 6 months thereafter . \n there was no recurrence during the follow - up period . \n our results suggest that coh - ivf may be acceptable for infertile patients with bot , especially in patients with early - stage bot after conservative treatment .

,\nimportant factors for late recovery and discharge are postoperative pain , paralytic ileus , and organ dysfunction related to surgical stress , but many other factors also play a role , such as immobilization , postoperative cognitive dysfunction , and local hospital traditions such as nasogastric tubes , drain , and urinary catheter postoperatively .\nperioperative care has been improved in the last 20 years with development of minimally invasive surgery , newer anesthetic and analgesic techniques , and other factors to reduce the surgical stress ( kehlet & dahl , 2003 ; white et al . , 2007 ) .\nenhanced recovery after surgery ( eras ) is a multimodal approach that aims to optimize perioperative management ( fearon et al . , 2005 ) .\nthe eras program is a package of evidence - based changes in preoperative , intraoperative , and postoperative care to reduce organ dysfunction and surgical stress response to promote rapid recovery ( kehlet , 2008 ; ren et al . ,\neras guidelines were first published for colorectal surgery and in recent years also for other major procedures in gastrointestinal surgery , urology , and gynecology , and include mostly around 15 to 20 perioperative elements .\nthe key elements of an enhanced recovery pathway are ( a ) extended patient information , ( b ) preservation of gastrointestinal function ( carbohydrate solution before surgery , early enteral feeding ) , ( c ) minimizing organ dysfunction ( omission of mechanical bowel preparation , goal - directed fluid therapy , avoidance of drains and nasogastric tube , minimally invasive surgery ) , ( d ) active pain control ( opioid - sparing anesthesia and analgesia , local anesthetic infiltration of incisions ) , and ( e ) promotion of patient autonomy with early mobilization ( adamina , kehlet , tomlinson , senagore , & delaney , 2011 ) . the more eras elements\nare implemented , the more frequently the postoperative course is improved ( gustafsson et al . , 2011 ) .\nstudies have demonstrated that eras is safe and shortens the length of the hospital stay ( adamina et al . , 2011 ; varadhan et al . ,\nhowever , elderly patients have either been excluded

bleeding , pleuritis , subcutaneous infections , antibiotic treated infection unknown cause , early stoma related complications , transient ischemic attack with normal mri . there were no significant differences in the subgroups of minor complications in the three groups of age .\nalthough total oral intake on the day of surgery was somewhat lower in patients aged 80 years , there were no significant differences in intraoperative fluid load , intravenous fluid , total oral intake , or mobilization after surgery .\nfurthermore , there were no differences in the number of patients with preoperative counseling , omission of bowel preparation , intake of carbohydrate - loaded drinks before surgery , omission of preoperative fasting and premedication , postoperative laxative , thoracic epidural analgesia , type of anesthesia , prevention of hypothermia , and days to removal of the urinary tract catheter .\nthe goal of this substudy was to evaluate the short - term outcomes of elderly and younger patients undergoing open and laparoscopic colorectal surgery using an eras protocol , and to see whether elderly patients could adhere to an eras program .\nour main findings were that elderly patients equally adhered well to and benefitted from an eras program as younger patients according to the main outcome of reduced length of hospital stay .\nas the original study was a randomized trial , we believe that our results are based on a representative selection of patients who met the inclusion criteria . a number of prospective and retrospective studies have demonstrated a similar length of stay when older and younger cohorts are compared ( baek et al . , 2013 ;\nkahokehr , sammour , sahakian , zargar - shoshtari , & hill , 2011 ; keller , lawrence , nobel , & delaney , 2013 ; pawa , cathcart , arulampalam , tutton , & motson , 2012 ; senagore et al . , 2003 ;\nverheijen , vd ven , davids , vd wall , & pronk , 2012 ; walter et al . , 2011 ) , while other studies found longer length of stay in older patients ( feroci et al . , 2013\ntwo randomized controlled trials comparing eras with standard of care in elderly patients found significantly reduced length of hospital stay in patients allocated to eras care ( jia et al . , 2014 ; wang et al . , 2012 ) .\nhowever , the definition of various age groups differed widely in all these studies . in our study , there were no significant differences in ths between the age groups .\nhowever , ths in the age group 80 years was 2 days longer than in the age group < 65 years .\nthis may be due to logistical challenges , such as home care situation , or the patient s own wishes .\nelderly patients are often living alone which implies that they have to be fit enough to manage their home situation by themselves .\neven if discharge criteria are fulfilled , elderly patients may not be fit enough and have to wait for nursing home placement .\nthis is in line with others who found that older patients remained in hospital for further 3 to 5 days after they met the criteria for safe discharge ( rumstadt et al . , 2009 )\n. it might be a limitation of our study that we did not measure days until discharge criteria were fulfilled , but only ths . as expected , patients in the oldest cohort in our study had more comorbidities and a higher proportion of malignancies than the younger age groups .\nage is the single highest risk factor for developing cancer , and older patients are more likely to have malignant than benign tumors ( parks , rostoft , ommundsen , & cheung , 2015 ) .\ndecision making regarding surgery in elderly patients is challenging because these patients have more comorbidities as well as functional and cognitive impairments . the proportion of patients aged 80 years not included in the study was higher compared with the other age groups .\nthis could represent a selection bias toward inclusion of more fit patients in the oldest age group , and exclusion of those who were considered frail and unable to adapt to the eras criteria as assessed by the study surgeons .\nthis might reflect that a subgroup of elderly patients is not suitable for an eras program , although this may also be the case in younger frail patients .\ninterestingly , however , frailty does not necessarily exist in patients with many comorbidities , and some elderly patients with little or no concomitant disease appear to be frail ( fried et al . , 2001 ) .\nwe did not apply frailty risk stratification in our analysis , for example , by  comprehensive geriatric assessment  or \nfried criteria ,  and therefore , we can not state the proportion of frail patients in the different age groups .\nthe length of stay in the oldest age group may have been favorably influenced by the significantly increased proportion of patients undergoing hemicolectomies and the reduced proportion undergoing rectal resections compared with younger patients ( table 2 ) .\na recently published systematic review of eras care after colorectal surgery in elderly patients found 11 studies comparing older and younger cohorts ( bagnall et al . , 2014 ) .\nseven out of the 11 studies found no difference in mortality ( baek et al . ,\n2013 ; hendry et al . , 2009 ; keller et al . , 2013 ; naef , kasemodel , mouton , & wagner , 2010 ; rumstadt et al . , 2009 ;\ntwo studies did not report on mortality , and two found higher 30-day mortality in patients aged > 80 years ( feroci et al . , 2013 ; pawa et al . ,\n; two studies did not report complications ; and four studies found more complications in older patients ( feroci et al .\n, 2013 ; naef et al . , 2010 ; pawa et al . , 2012 ; rumstadt et al . ,\nhowever , the definitions of the elderly age groups in the studies included in the review varied considerably , ranging from ages > 65 to 80 years\n. we divided the patients into three age groups to see whether there were differences between those aged 65 to 79 years and those aged 80 years compared with younger patients .\nconsidering the low number of patients aged 80 years , we could have divided the patients in two age groups instead of three .\nhowever , we think it would not be appropriate to dichotomize the patients into age groups above or below 65 years , which often is done . on the contrary\n, we think that our grouping reflects the various age groups who undergo colorectal resections properly with regard to their physical characteristics and different stages of life .\nthis view is supported by regression analysis with age as a continuous variable that did not reveal any correlation between age and the outcomes variables . in elderly patients ,\ntreatment decisions and the choice of surgical intervention should therefore be based on biological characteristics rather than chronological age .\nthe term frailty , which includes decreased reserves in general and deterioration in multiple organ systems , has been introduced .\nthe frailty evaluation is important to avoid over- and undertreatment , which is a well - known pitfall in geriatric oncology ( ommundsen et al . , 2014 )\n. currently , there are no simple tests available to predict postoperative outcome for frail elderly patients .\nthe comprehensive geriatric assessment is recognized as the best tool for evaluating elderly patients preoperatively ( feng et al .\nunfortunately , it is time - consuming and might be difficult to use in a busy surgical clinical practice ( ugolini et al . , 2015 ) .\nit seems , however , reasonable that this extra time spent in identifying and treating correctable conditions in complex patients may decrease postoperative complications and length of hospital stay . as a consequence of this study , in collaboration with our anesthesiologists\nadherence to the eras approach means to which extent the patients are able to implement the eras program .\nconducting an eras program depends on both the provider ( surgeons and nurses ) and the patient .\nprevious studies have demonstrated good compliance with preoperative and intraoperative eras elements , but reduced adherence during the postoperative phase ( hendry et al . ,\nhowever , it has been suggested that compliance with postoperative rather than preoperative eras elements is likely to be of particular importance for good progress and accelerated postoperative recovery ( maessen et al . , 2007 ) .\n( 2009 ) identified age > 80 years and higher asa score as independent predictors of prolonged mobilization . in our study\n, we found no differences in compliance to the various eras elements between the different age groups .\nalso , no difference was found in the level of mobilization in contrast to other studies that have reported differences in levels of mobilization ( hendry et al . , 2009 ;\nwe feel that it is highly likely that more elderly patients would benefit from special supervision and the guidance of specialist nurses in eras , particularly the postoperative eras elements , even if it is not possible to implement the entire program . as expected , the elderly cohort in our study had more comorbidity and more malignancies than the younger age group .\nelderly patients with more comorbidities might be expected to have higher rates of mortality and complications and experience longer hospital stays than younger patients .\nour results show the safety of the eras program in elderly patients who are able to adapt to the eras criteria .\nwe believe that more elderly patients should receive such perioperative treatment , and it is highly likely that they will have similar length of stay and the same rate of postoperative readmissions and complications as the younger patients ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " aim

table  1).table 1a comparison of candidate gene and genome - wide approaches to genetic association studiescandidate genevs.gwasa very small fraction of the genome is typically analyzedcovers up to 80  % of the genomerequired a strong a priori hypothesisis a hypothesis - free or hypothesis - generating approacha more statistically powerful approachcompared to candidate genes , the needed correction for multiple testing leads to low powersuitable for identifying variants of large and small effecttypically more suitable for identifying variants of larger effect \n can include rarer variants and nonsnp variants such as variable number of tandem repeats ( vntrs)traditionally includes common variation ( snp occurring in < 1  % of the population , although some gwas chips contain rarer variants and/or are customizable ) \n this is dependent on sample size a comparison of candidate gene and genome - wide approaches to genetic association studies \n this is dependent on sample size in the early years of genetic research , a candidate gene approach was taken to identify putative loci associated with health . in this approach\n, a select number of variants within a pathway implicated in the development of a trait of interest would be analyzed for association with the trait .\nthe lack of replication among candidate gene studies across a range of phenotypes led to the conclusion that candidate approaches on their own were unsuitable for identifying the complement of genetic variants associated with human disease .\nit was acknowledged that the pathways between candidate genes and disease - related traits were more numerous , and more complex , than previously thought , presenting challenges to generating a priori hypotheses about the putative gene regions .\nrelative to candidate gene methods , chips allowed for quick and cheap genotyping of 500,0003,000,000 common single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) spaced somewhat evenly across the whole genome .\nthis technological advance allowed researchers to survey loci across the genome for associations with health outcomes in a hypothesis - free manner , holding the promise of identifying new pathways between genes and disease .\nthe initiation and success of the international hapmap project further bolstered the science community s belief that gwas would enable the identification of the snps accounting for the genetic variation underlying human health .\nthe international hapmap project outlined the correlational structure between snps across the genome , which enabled researchers to impute data from the snps genotyped on a single chip to provide information on approximately 80  % of the human genome . with the potential for hypothesis - free survey of almost all of the genome\n, there was enormous optimism at the start of the  gwas era  that science would fairly rapidly start to account for the majority of the genetic variance associated with traits of interest .\nto date , science has failed to do so . even for some of the most commonly studied traits , such as body mass index ( bmi ) ,\nin addition , the majority of initial genome - wide significant findings failed to replicate .\nin recognition of this , and of the limitation that many putative loci may lie just under the threshold for genome - wide significance , many have called for a two - stage approach to gene - hunting : a discovery phase in which a genome - wide scan is conducted , and then a replication phase in which all hits from the first phase reaching a given threshold ( often p  <  1.0 * 10 - 5 ; but can be between p  <  10 * -4 - 10 * 6 ) are examined for associations in one or more independent samples .\nit is hoped that this approach will prevent the false negatives which the stringent bonferroni correction typically applied to gwas studies has given rise to , but equally , prevent the \nthe failure of gwas to account for the heritable variance has been termed the  missing heritability  .\nthe reasons for missing heritability are numerous and highly debated , but include the use of genetically complex phenotypes , the notion that rare variants may play a more important role than previously realized and smaller effect sizes than initially anticipated [ 14 , 15 ] .\nthese well - recognized challenges pose grave problems for identifying how genetic background moderates the association between dietary patterns and health .\nin identifying loci that interact with a given dietary pattern , researchers are confronted with a difficult choice : does one take a candidate locus approach , or survey the whole genome in a hypothesis - free manner with a gwas ?\nenvironment interaction studies , which generally choose snps and diets associated with a disease  or trait  in previous research in order to examine whether snps and dietary patterns interact . to my knowledge , although many studies have examined the effects of interactions between genetic variants and individual nutrients on health , only two single - cohort studies have examined gene  diet interactions with dietary patterns .\nthe first study reported that weight loss on a mediterranean style diet was moderated by variation at rs1801260 in the circadian locomotor output cycles kaput ( clock ) gene .\nthe second study reported that weight loss on the mediterranean diet over a three - year period was significantly lower in a allele carriers of rs9939609 in the fat mass and obesity - associated ( fto ) gene compared to those homozygous for the t allele .\npromising though these results are , they are notable for a lack of replication and validation . some of the strongest gene \nenvironment research has come out of consortia such as the cohorts for heart and aging research in genomic epidemiology ( charge ) consortium .\nconsortia such as charge employ data meta - analyzed across a number of cohorts , which may therefore be considered more robust and more powerful than single - cohort studies .\na very focused candidate gene study used data from 15 cohorts to examine whether the associations of polymorphisms in the lipoprotein receptor - related protein 1 ( lrp1 ) gene with bmi , waist circumference , and hip circumference were modified by fatty acid intake .\nthe study reported that saturated fatty acid intake was associated with all three anthropometric traits , and interacted with rs2306692 in lrp1 such that the association between saturated fatty acids and each anthropometric data was stronger for each of the anthropometric traits for each copy of the t allele [ 23 ] .\nthis interaction was present in whites but not in african - americans [ 23 ] . more often , however , the candidate gene approach to identifying gene \nmeta - analyzed across 14 charge cohorts of european ancestry , total zinc intake was associated with fasting glucose ( p  =  0.0003 ) but did not significantly interact with glucose - raising alleles after a correction for multiple testing .\nsimilarly , a meta - analysis of the same cohorts reported that whole - grain food intake was strongly associated with fasting glucose and insulin ( p-.0003 - < 0.00001 ) , but no significant interactions were found with snps known to influence fasting glucose and insulin levels . in possibly the only study to examine interactions between genes and a dietary pattern rather than a single macro- or micronutrient , an analysis across 15 cohorts from charge investigated whether a  healthy diet  altered the associations between glucose- and insulin - associated snps and fasting levels .\n healthy diet  was a single score defined a priori based on self - reported intake of nine food groups .\nthese favorable foods were whole grains , fish , fruits , vegetables , and nuts / seeds .\nred and processed meats , sweets , sugared beverages , and fried potatoes all contributed negatively to the healthy diet score [ 26 ] . as expected based on previous research , the healthy diet score was inversely associated with fasting glucose and insulin ; for each unit increase , there was a 0.004  mmol / l decrease in glucose and a 0.0058  mmol / l decrease in insulin .\nhowever , the score did not interact with known glucose- and insulin - related snps on the glycaemia measures [ 26 ] . in many studies , snp  diet interactions reached suggestive levels of significance , which did not survive a multiple testing correction , and thus it is not clear whether power is an issue .\nnonetheless , it is likely that the challenges faced by main - effect association studies are also faced by gene  diet interaction studies .\nas over 95  % of the mechanistic pathways from genes to chronic diseases such as obesity , cardiovascular disease , and cancer remain opaque , it is challenging to select which putative loci are involved in these pathways and thus should be analyzed in the context of gene  diet interactions [ 15 , 27 , 28 ] .\nin addition , selecting variants for interaction analysis is challenging in light of data simulations showing that the most significant associations from gwas are not likely to be those variants which interact with the environment to influence phenotypes of interest [ 2931 ] .\nrather , since gwas detects variants of relatively large effect , and the presence of an interaction with diet is likely to weaken the detected main effect , it is likely that the  sub - threshold  variants are those which hold promise for gene  diet interactions [ 2931 ] . focusing on genetic loci\nas yet , however , there is no empirical or theoretical threshold for selecting these variants .\ngenome - wide interaction study ( gwis ) approaches also pose unique difficulties : with a given sample and effect size , a study has less power to detect gene  environment interactions than genetic main effects .\nfull gwis approaches therefore require the accrual of large sample sizes . while many successful consortia have been established , these bring the additional challenge of harmonizing diet data across cohorts .\ndietary data are typically measured in one of a number of ways , including through food frequency questionnaires ( ffqs ) , dietary diary analysis , and interview - led diet history interviews .\nin addition , if a dietary pattern is defined in part by a macronutrient variable , it may be that the constituent components of that macronutrient differ across cohorts defined by , for example , ethnicity or geographic location .\nthe gwis approach still holds promise for identifying gene  diet interactions . in a genome - wide analysis of 9,287 colorectal cancer cases and\n9,117 unaffected control controls across ten independent studies , a significant interaction was found between a variant near the trans - acting t - cell - specific transcription factor ( gata3 ) gene and processed meat intake on colorectal cancer status [ 33 ] .\nthe association between processed meat intake and colorectal cancer was only present among those who were t allele carriers [ 33 ] .\nin addition , this study focused on a single food group rather than an overall pattern of intake , making it difficult to derive clinical advice from the results .\nnumerous challenges remain in the quest to determine the dietary pattern that will convey the most protection against chronic disease , given an individual s genetic background .\neven with a candidate gene approach which is powered to detect smaller effect sizes than a gwis approach , the very small effect sizes found for suggestive interactions ( those that are significant but do not survive a correction from multiple testing ) suggest that power still remains an issue [ 24 , 25 ] .\none solution to dealing with small effect sizes for interactions with individual snps has been to use a genetic risk score ( grs ) .\na genetic risk score is a sum of alleles taken across several genes known to convey deleterious effects on the same phenotype . by summing the effects of several snps ,\nrecently , studies adopting this approach have met with some success , as witnessed in the following two illustrative examples .\na grs constructed of 63 obesity - associated alleles was found to interact with a diet high in total  and especially saturated  fat intake on bmi in two independent populations .\nwhen saturated fat intake was low , every additional risk allele in the grs was associated with an increase in bmi of 0.110.20 ; when saturated fat intake was high , each risk allele conveyed an addition increase of 0.190.41 bmi points . in a similar study ,\na higher grs score ( more risk alleles across 32 bmi - associated loci ) increased the association between bmi and sugar - sweetened beverage intake ; per increment of 10 risk alleles , the increase in bmi points was 1.00 for an intake of less than one serving per month , 1.12 for one to four servings per month , 1.38 for two to six servings per week , and 1.78 for one or more servings per day ( p  <  0.001 for interaction ) .\nthis may convey an advantage since , as previously discussed , the top gwas hits may not contain snps that associate with the phenotype of interest through gene \nhowever , a limitation of the grs approach is that it fails to consider potential interactions between the alleles comprising the grs ( gene  gene interactions ) , and further , offers little mechanistic insight into how genes modify the effect of dietary pattern on health , since grss often subsume many mechanistic pathways .\nthere still remain several issues that researchers need to resolve if we are to identify the dietary pattern that is most protective against chronic diseases for each individual , given their genetic background .\nonly a few articles could be identified in which the interaction between dietary patterns and genetic variation on health were analyzed [ 26 ] .\nthis may reflect difficulties with how  dietary pattern  should be defined and what it should be compared to .\ndietary intake , in general , reflects a continuum of adherence to a given dietary pattern rather than a yes / no approach . defining how closely someone adheres to , for example\n, the dash diet requires the quantification of guidelines , which may be tricky to achieve across diverse cohorts .\nin addition , the implication of the anticipated small effect sizes goes beyond the need for large sample sizes , and reflects the larger question of clinical utility : what is the role of expensive genetic tests if they may only inform on a difference of 0.004 \nmmol / l in fasting glucose [ 26 ] , when dietary changes alone may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes by up to 31  % ?\nwhile the clinical utility of understanding how genes moderate the association of dietary pattern with health has not yet been fulfilled , the potential benefits of using genetic background to design a personalized dietary approach for the prevention of chronic disease remain . the popularity of home - based nutrigenomic tests , while scientifically questionable , reflects public desire for personalized nutrition advice .\nthere are many methodological challenges to overcome , shared with all of human genetic research , before we can identify the putative variants that interact with dietary patterns .\nthese challenges center on the lack of power for gwis approaches , but the theoretical and empirical difficulties in identifying loci a priori for a candidate gene approach .\ndietary nutrients do not act in isolation , and as guidelines for preventing chronic disease focus on overall holistic diet , understanding which dietary pattern an individual should adhere to may present the most promise for improving public health . to address this question\n, we are going to need to combine data from studies employing a host of statistical approaches .\ndiet interactions , but to gain mechanistic insights , these will have to complement candidate gene approaches .\nin addition , as we do not fully understand the pathways between genes and chronic disease , and have identified snps which only account for a small proportion of the underlying genetic variance , gwis approaches will be vital for identifying new related loci .\n, dietary advice for optimum health will remain at the population  rather than individual  level , and many benefits of dietary change on health may be lost ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " several dietary approaches have been proposed to prevent the onset of chronic diseases . \n as yet , no single approach has emerged as having the most consistent health benefits . \n this arises , in part , due to the fact that diet influences health in the context of individual factors with genetic components . \n therefore , the effects of diet on health may be dependent on an individual s genetic background . at this time we lack robust evidence for the effects of interactions between genes and dietary patterns on health . to understand why , \n i will briefly review the most methodologically strong attempts to identify gene  diet interactions , which will illuminate how the challenges facing all of genetic research apply to the search for gene  diet interactions . \n then i will discuss some ways in which these challenges are being addressed that offer hope for the future in which the best diet for an individual is identified based on their genetic variation .

however , there are some evidence - based and non - evidence - based statistical data about the cases of induced abortion in iran . according to the only reliable source of data in the country , approximately 80 thousand cases of\nunsafe abortion occur in iran annually ( 11 ) . based on the results of a study in tehran ,\nthe results of an indirect estimation showed that the mean experience of induced abortions during pregnancy was 1.07 among iranian women ( 13 ) . according to the results of a study by erfani and mcquillan ,\nthe overall rate of abortion in iran was an estimated 0.26 for any married woman , in other words of every four women married , a woman experience induced abortion during her reproductive age ( 14 ) . according to the results of a study which was conducted in eight hospitals in isfahan , the prevalence of induced abortions was 12% ( 15 ) .\nin addition , nikpour et al . conducted a study to determine the frequency of induced abortion and its related factors in women who were referred to hospitals in the south of tehran ; the results of their study showed that 26.7% of the studied women underwent induced and illegal abortions ( 16 ) . obviously , as there is no access to the data about the illegal abortion centers and since women may fear the legal and social consequences of induced abortion , the actual prevalence of abortion is expected to be higher than the reported statistical data .\nin addition , the statistical data reported from many developing countries indicate a high incidence of induced abortions and illegal abortions ; for instance , the overall prevalence of abortion in urban areas of nigeria is 49.6% , of which 82.2% of cases are induced abortions ( 17 ) .\nbecause of legal and religious concerns , abortion is one of the most private personal issues , and people are tended to hide and not report the cases of abortion ; hence , conducting qualitative research may greatly help to collect data related to abortion . on the other hand , abortion and its various aspects\nhas been the subject of widespread moral , religious , political , and legal debates in many countries , while in most cases no attention has been paid to the views of women who are victims of abortion .\nbecause of the differences in cultural and social backgrounds , to understand complex phenomena such as abortion , it is necessary to make deep investigations without any presumption .\nto prevent induced abortion and related high risk behaviors and outcomes , it is necessary to identify factors such as attitude influencing women s decisions and behavior to continue or terminate their pregnancy .\nattitude toward the behavior includes positive and negative assessments of a behavior ( 18 ) .\nbehavioral beliefs result in positive or negative attitude about the continuation or termination of the pregnancy . according to ajzen and fishbein\n, behavioral beliefs are what the people expect about the outcomes of a specific behavior ( 19 ) .\ntherefore , in this study behavioral beliefs are the outcomes which women expect to achieve after undergoing induced abortion .\nthe results of some studies show that women s beliefs towards abortion are among the most important factors influencing their decision for abortion ( 20 ) . for as much as according to the forensic report , in 2014 the highest abortion requests were respectively in the cities of tehran , mashhad and ahvaz ( 21 ) , and\nalso given the importance of induced abortion and its impact on the lives of women , considering the high prevalence of induced abortion , and as there are a limited number of studies on this subject , this qualitative research study was designed to investigate and discover the outcomes which women expected to achieve after undergoing induced abortion .\nin this qualitative study , direct and indirect experiences of the participants were investigated and analyzed to explain the women s expected gains from undergoing induced abortion .\nthe participants who reported a history of abortion ( without medical indication ) in a recent pregnancy were deep interviewed until data saturation .\noverall , a total of 21 deep interviews were conducted during february to september 2014 .\nthe interviews were performed in a relatively quiet location in imam khomeini and razi hospital of ahvaz and also a number of health centers .\neach interview , depending on the content and conditions , lasted 30 to 90 minutes . before the interviews , we recoded the demographic and personal characteristics of women and their husbands such as age , employment status of women and their spouses , education level and ethnicity of women and their spouses , and number of pregnancies .\nall interviews were conducted by a member of the research team . at the beginning of each interview\n, some questions were raised to make the interviewer more familiar with the participants , and also to create an intimate atmosphere .\nwhat was your expected outcome that motivated you to undergo induced abortion ?  or  what outcomes did you expect when you underwent induced abortion ?  then to complete the themes , considering their earlier responses , more specific questions were asked .\nwe tried to select participants from different groups in terms of education , occupation , and ethnicity .\nthe second group included general informants who had indirect experience and were somehow familiar with the participants from the first group ( this group included two health care experts and a woman whose sister died due to the complication of induced abortion ) .\ninterviews were recorded and some notes which described the moods and attitudes of participants , were taken .\nthen , the interviews were transcribed verbatim . to analyze the data , we used thematic analysis method . immediately after each interview , the recorded audios were listened to , and the transcribes were read several times by all members of the research team ; then every unit of meaning was extracted and the initial coding were carried out based on the analysis of the interviews with the participants .\nthen we made constant comparison and formed the subthemes based on the similarities and differences between initial codes ; continuing the same process , the main themes and themes were determined .\ntranscribed interviews , the initial codes , subthemes , and themes were reviewed several times , and if necessary , the codes were revised , and previous themes were split or merged , and new themes and major themes were formed . to ensure trustworthiness of findings\n, we made an enduring and continuous contact with mothers and other participants ( 22 ) .\npart of the text and the initial codes were presented to the participants to check the consistency between the codes extracted by the researchers and the views stated by the participants ( member check ) ; using this method , we compared the interpretations of the researchers and the opinions of the participants . to check the scientific strength of the study , generated data , codes and categories were controlled by all members of the team ( peer check ) as well as experts outside the team , who had an experience of qualitative research in the relevant field ( external check ) . to ensure the transferability of data , the participants were selected from different socio - economic levels and from different ethnic groups .\nthe participants were enrolled in the study after obtaining a written informed consent ; they were assured that the collected information would remain anonymous and confidential .\nwe studied direct and indirect experiences of 21 people , including 18 women with a history of induced abortion , one expert with 12 years of experience in providing prenatal care at health centers , one midwife with eight years of experience in women s wards , and one women whose sister died due to the complications of induced abortion .\nthe mean age of participants was 29.16  6.61 years ( with a range of 1844 years ) .\nmost women said that the decision to undergo induced abortion was the most difficult decision in their lives , which had been associated with stress , confusion , and fear .\nthis group of women said that the experience of abortion was the worst experience in their lives . in 70% of cases induced abortion\nthe abortion was induced via the use of vaginal suppositories and prostaglandin ampoules which had been purchased from pharmacies or midwifery clinics or were provided by midwives and gynecologists . due to the sensitivity of the issue , and because of the stress and regret of abortion\nthey were asked the following questions :  what was your expected outcome that motivated you to undergo induced abortion ?  or  what outcomes did you expect when\nyou underwent induced abortion ?  based on the collected data , three major themes were extracted from their experiences , which included the following : 1 . expected favorable health - related outcomes of induced abortion , 2 . expected favorable economic outcomes of induced abortion , and 3\ntherefore , the studied women underwent induced abortion to achieve these three outcomes . in the following sections ( 3.1 . to 3.3 ) , we present details about each of the extracted themes and subthemes .\nthis theme included two sub - themes : 1 ) expected value of induced abortion for preventing the birth of a child with congenital disorders , and 2 ) expected value of induced abortion for maintaining and improving the health and beauty of mother .\nthe majority of studied women stated that they underwent abortion because they believed it could prevent the birth of a child with congenital disorders .\nthey expected that the termination of pregnancy could help them to prevent the birth of a child with defects caused by maternal age and consanguineous marriage .\ninduced abortion in older ages for preventing the birth of a child with congenital disorders : induced abortion is sometimes undertaken by older women to prevent the effect of maternal old age on children .\nas i was aware of the problems of pregnancy in older ages and the higher risk of having a sick baby due to consanguineous marriage , i felt that i would not have a good pregnancy .\n( participant 16 , 36 years old ) . induced abortion in consanguineous marriages for preventing the birth of a child with congenital disorders : consanguineous marriage and its possible effects were among women s concerns ; according to the participants , women sometimes undergo induced abortion in order to prevent these types of problems .\na mother stated that :  because of the consanguineous marriage we worried about the future of our children .\nwe had fears that our child might have a problem .  ( participants 11 , 26 years old ) .\ninduced abortion for preventing the birth of another child with congenital disorders : mothers who previously had a child with congenital disorders underwent induced abortion to prevent the repetition of birth anomalies .\ni was not upset because of my pregnancy , it was sad that i had a sick kid and i feared to have another sick child .\nmy son was 6 months old when he was born ; he was kept in an incubator for one month and 18 days .\ni was just involved in the treatment of my first child ; the abortion could help me to spend more time with my sick child .\ni did not know what percentage the new baby would be healthy , but i was not able to accept the risk .\ni asked myself which one is more difficult , having two sick children , or undergoing the difficulties of abortion ?  ( participant 1 , 32 years old ) .\nwe found some sub - themes for the expected value of induced abortion for maintaining and improving the health and beauty of the mother ; the sub - themes were as follows : 1 ) prevention of the risks associated with short time intervals between pregnancies , 2 ) prevention of the exacerbation of maternal diseases , 3 ) prevention of pain and complications of labor , and 4 ) maintaining beauty and prevention of body deformity .\nprevention of the risks associated with short time intervals between pregnancies in cases where the time interval between two pregnancies was less than two years , mothers expected that the termination of pregnancy could help them to avoid the related complications .\nan arabic - speaking participant said :  my children were too young , one of them was four years old , and the other was 1.5 years old .\ni could not bear the third child so soon ... ,  she continued : \nwe had a rented house and the costs of life were too much . however , my main reason for undergoing abortion was that my children were too young .\ni am still too weak . because of the pregnancy , me and my husband were too upset and nervous . \n( participant 6 , 25 years old ) most women with a short time interval between their pregnancies believed that they had become physically weak because of the new pregnancy .\nthey expected that the termination of pregnancy would allow them a chance to spend more time for themselves and their childrens health .\nfor example , one of the participants , who was the mother of 6-month - old twins said : \ni had not yet recovered , however i become pregnant soon after the birth of the twins . at that time , i was breast - feeding the twins and i was forced to stop breast - feeding . \nanother participant said :  my first baby is still six months old , and i am affected by anemia .\nat least three years is required to prepare a mother again for having a new child \nprevention of the exacerbation of maternal diseases . in cases when the maternal morbidity was not medically severe and there was no legal permit for abortion , women terminated their pregnancy based on their own personal decisions .\na participant , who was a behvarz , stated that  me and my husband decided not be have another children at all , because i have asthma and in my last pregnancy i faced too many difficulties .\ni became pregnant while i was 15 kg overweight ... my husband was working as an employee , and he had an overweight colleague who became pregnant and consequently suffered from high blood pressure .\nit was predicted that i might have twins ; i knew that such a condition made my condition worse . \n( participant 4 , 29 years old ) prevention of labor pain and complications of delivery some women contributing in our study , reported that they terminated their pregnancy to prevent the problems and consequences of cesarean section .\nafter the second cesarean , i suffered from many problems , both physically and mentally .\ni was again reminded of all that had happened to me .  ( participants 14 , 32 years old ) another mother raised her experiences as follows : \ni beared all the labor pain , but they said that the condition of the baby is not good .\nit was hard . for a long time i had pain at the suture site .\ni had back pain ; i could not walk . in the last pregnancy , i thought i could not bear all that pain . \n( participants 12 , 30 years old ) some of the participants also said that they underwent induced abortion due to the fear of vaginal delivery , the expected pain , and suffering , and fear of repeating the unpleasant experience of past pregnancy and childbirth .\none of the participants said :  in the previous pregnancy i was on a complete bed rest .\ni had a terrible pregnancy craving when i was pregnant . for four months i suffered from nausea and vomiting .\n( participant 5 , 30 years old ) another mother said :  in my previous pregnancies , i had a vaginal natural delivery .\nmaybe , if i had undergone cesarean section delivery , i would not have a fear of delivery .\n( participant 10 , 44 years old ) some of the participants underwent induced abortion to prevent the undesirable effects of pregnancy and delivery , on their mental health .\n( participant 14 , 32 years old ) maintaining beauty and prevention of body deformity one of the sub - themes which were found in this study was the concerns of younger participants regarding the physical consequences of pregnancy .\nbecause they feared that the continuation of pregnancy would reduce their bodily beauty , they had terminated the pregnancy to maintain the good shape of their body .\none of the participants said :  in my previous pregnancy , i gained 20 kg of weight . because of the change in my size , i was not able to wear my previously bought clothes\nwhenever i went shopping , i felt depressed , because my new body size was forty - eight .\nthey do not wish to observe a change in their appearance as a result of pregnancy .\nfor the same reason , many mothers do not breast feed their babies and give various excuses .\ni knew a lady who was a sports coach ; she told me pregnancy made her fat , hence even though it was her first child , she decided to undergo an abortion . \nthis theme was extracted from the experiences of participants separately or together with other themes .\nthis theme included two sub - themes : job preservation and promotion , and prevention of an increase in the cost of living .\nthey expected that that their pregnancy threatened their daily life and work ; hence , they thought that induced abortion could help them to preserve their jobs .\none of the participants who had terminated her first pregnancy stated that :  it was two years after marriage , when finally i was hired in a finance organization ; i was very happy . by continuing pregnancy\nnow my husband is unemployed and i am in charge of living costs and expenditures .\nif i had continued the pregnancy , surely i would have not had any other job opportunity .\ni had made many attempts , throughout the year , for the move ; i had just obtained a permit to move and i had not moved to the new workplace .\nafter a month since the day i had started my work , without having to tell anybody that i am pregnant , i underwent abortion . \nanother participant said :  motherhood is a good thing but not for me , as i work until 4 pm every day .\nall my family was living in another province , we had a rented apartment , and my husband was unemployed .\ni wanted to terminate everything soon and i wanted everything to be as it was . \na number of women believed that pregnancy and having children could increase the cost of living ; hence they had decided to terminate their pregnancies to prevent such costs .\nfor instance , one of the participants said :  i have to spend too much for my twins .\nmy husband is working in a battery store , and he has a very low income , we have a rented apartment ( participant 3 , 18 years old ) .\none of the participants who had a history of 12 pregnancies and four abortions , including three induced abortions and one spontaneous abortion , said : \nwhen you live in a 12-meter room , how could you want a baby ? we do not have bread to eat ,\nif i had the three aborted children i think we all would have died of hunger . \na public health expert said :  the majority of them have many financial problems and they even borrow money for their daily costs of living .\nwe have no choice except to give them the address of places where induced abortion is performed in secret . \nthis theme had two sub - themes , including the following : expected effects of pregnancy termination on improving family relationships and on prevention of conflicts and disputes in the family , and expected effect of pregnancy termination on improving educational status .\none of them said :  we had a short engagement period , and soon we got married .\nabout one or two months after marriage , i found that i was pregnant . because of the pregnancy we even decided to divorce in the early months of marriage .\nthe family of my husband did not have a good view to this marriage and they even pushed my husband to divorce .\n finally , i found the address of someone who performed a secret abortion . \n( participant 4 , 29 years old ) one of the women who underwent induced abortion to improve family relationships , said : \n32 years old ) one of the other participants expressed her experience and said :  since the time of marriage , my husband had no interest in our life .\nthe abortion helped to keep our problems at the same level , not worsening it . \n( participant 9 , 42 years old ) . some of the participants terminated pregnancy to prevent the escalation of family problems .\none of them said :  i did not want to exacerbate the family condition at all .\nmy husband is unemployed and on the other hand is suffering from mental and psychological illnesses .\nunfortunately , he is a drug addict and now he is in a rehabilitation center .\na woman whose sister died of severe bleeding after induced abortion said :  the husband s family did not know they were married .\nher husband is now in prison ; he disagreed with the pregnancy . to keep the story hidden ,\nthey asked a midwife to terminate the abortion ; the midwife used a knitting mill or something like that .\nwe transferred her to a hospital , but she did not receive enough care and she died there ( crying ) .  ( participant 19 , 38 years old ) this sub - theme was extracted from the experiences of younger women , especially those who were college students . a large percentage of women married while they were studying and a lot of them decided to continue their education after the marriage\nthe desire to continue education and to study , was one of the reasons for the termination of pregnancy :  my last child was my son who was 6 years old .\nmy children had grown up and i had more time , hence i decided to continue my education .\nif i wanted to continue the pregnancy , i had no chance of continuing my education for a long time .  ( participant 16 , 36 years old ) one of the women said in a different statement : \ni always underestimated my capacities ; however , i could have been better than this .\nhowever , i did not undergo abortion because of my problems ; i performed abortion just because i had concern for them .\nthey will thank me in the other world .

( participant 5 , 30 years old )\nanother mother said :  in my previous pregnancies , i had a vaginal natural delivery .\nmaybe , if i had undergone cesarean section delivery , i would not have a fear of delivery .\n( participant 10 , 44 years old ) some of the participants underwent induced abortion to prevent the undesirable effects of pregnancy and delivery , on their mental health .\n( participant 14 , 32 years old ) maintaining beauty and prevention of body deformity one of the sub - themes which were found in this study was the concerns of younger participants regarding the physical consequences of pregnancy .\nbecause they feared that the continuation of pregnancy would reduce their bodily beauty , they had terminated the pregnancy to maintain the good shape of their body .\none of the participants said :  in my previous pregnancy , i gained 20 kg of weight .\nbecause of the change in my size , i was not able to wear my previously bought clothes . whenever i went shopping , i felt depressed , because my new body size was forty - eight .\n( participant 7 , 28 years old ) a midwife stated that :  the viewpoints of women have changed .\nthey do not wish to observe a change in their appearance as a result of pregnancy .\nfor the same reason , many mothers do not breast feed their babies and give various excuses .\ni knew a lady who was a sports coach ; she told me pregnancy made her fat , hence even though it was her first child , she decided to undergo an abortion . \nthis theme was extracted from the experiences of participants separately or together with other themes .\nthis theme included two sub - themes : job preservation and promotion , and prevention of an increase in the cost of living .\nthey expected that that their pregnancy threatened their daily life and work ; hence , they thought that induced abortion could help them to preserve their jobs .\none of the participants who had terminated her first pregnancy stated that :  it was two years after marriage , when finally i was hired in a finance organization ; i was very happy . by continuing pregnancy ,\nnow my husband is unemployed and i am in charge of living costs and expenditures .\nif i had continued the pregnancy , surely i would have not had any other job opportunity .\ni had made many attempts , throughout the year , for the move ; i had just obtained a permit to move and i had not moved to the new workplace .\nafter a month since the day i had started my work , without having to tell anybody that i am pregnant , i underwent abortion .  ( participant 5 , 30 years old ) .\nanother participant said :  motherhood is a good thing but not for me , as i work until 4 pm every day .\nall my family was living in another province , we had a rented apartment , and my husband was unemployed .\ni wanted to terminate everything soon and i wanted everything to be as it was . \na number of women believed that pregnancy and having children could increase the cost of living ; hence they had decided to terminate their pregnancies to prevent such costs .\nfor instance , one of the participants said :  i have to spend too much for my twins .\nmy husband is working in a battery store , and he has a very low income , we have a rented apartment ( participant 3 , 18 years old ) .\none of the participants who had a history of 12 pregnancies and four abortions , including three induced abortions and one spontaneous abortion , said :  after the fourth child i did not want any more children .\nwhen you live in a 12-meter room , how could you want a baby ? we do not have bread to eat ,\nif i had the three aborted children i think we all would have died of hunger . \na public health expert said :  the majority of them have many financial problems and they even borrow money for their daily costs of living .\nwe have no choice except to give them the address of places where induced abortion is performed in secret .  ( participant 20 , 38 years old ) .\nthey expected that that their pregnancy threatened their daily life and work ; hence , they thought that induced abortion could help them to preserve their jobs .\none of the participants who had terminated her first pregnancy stated that :  it was two years after marriage , when finally i was hired in a finance organization ; i was very happy . by continuing pregnancy\nnow my husband is unemployed and i am in charge of living costs and expenditures .\nif i had continued the pregnancy , surely i would have not had any other job opportunity .\ni had made many attempts , throughout the year , for the move ; i had just obtained a permit to move and i had not moved to the new workplace .\nafter a month since the day i had started my work , without having to tell anybody that i am pregnant , i underwent abortion . \nanother participant said :  motherhood is a good thing but not for me , as i work until 4 pm every day .\nall my family was living in another province , we had a rented apartment , and my husband was unemployed .\ni wanted to terminate everything soon and i wanted everything to be as it was . \na number of women believed that pregnancy and having children could increase the cost of living ; hence they had decided to terminate their pregnancies to prevent such costs .\nfor instance , one of the participants said :  i have to spend too much for my twins .\nmy husband is working in a battery store , and he has a very low income , we have a rented apartment ( participant 3 , 18 years old ) .\none of the participants who had a history of 12 pregnancies and four abortions , including three induced abortions and one spontaneous abortion , said :  after the fourth child i did not want any more children .\nwhen you live in a 12-meter room , how could you want a baby ? we do not have bread to eat ,\nif i had the three aborted children i think we all would have died of hunger . \na public health expert said :  the majority of them have many financial problems and they even borrow money for their daily costs of living .\nwe have no choice except to give them the address of places where induced abortion is performed in secret . \nthis theme had two sub - themes , including the following : expected effects of pregnancy termination on improving family relationships and on prevention of conflicts and disputes in the family , and expected effect of pregnancy termination on improving educational status .\none of them said :  we had a short engagement period , and soon we got married .\nabout one or two months after marriage , i found that i was pregnant . because of the pregnancy we even decided to divorce in the early months of marriage .\nthe family of my husband did not have a good view to this marriage and they even pushed my husband to divorce .\ni thought that abortion could help me to protect my marriage .

however , i could have been better than this .\nhowever , i did not undergo abortion because of my problems ; i performed abortion just because i had concern for them .\nin this study , which aimed to investigate the outcomes of induced abortion expected by women , three major themes were extracted .\nthe results showed that the studied women underwent induced abortion to achieve their favorable social , economic , and health outcomes . according to some theories and models of behavior , including the theory of expected value , people s expected outcomes of a behavior can encourage or discourage them to adopt that behavior ( 23 , 24 ) .\nin addition , as denoted in the theory of reasoned action and the theory of planned behavior , ajzen and fishbein argue that behavioral beliefs include people s expected outcome of their behaviors and thus they can influence a person s attitude towards the adoption or non - adoption of a specific behavior . according to their views , these beliefs are an important part of people s attitude toward a behavior they are going to undertake ( 25 ) .\nschaster believes that women , unlike their value statements which are the result of their defense mechanisms , when faced with the real situation and experience an unwanted pregnancy , will behave according to their true attitudes .\none of the expected outcomes of women undergoing induced abortions , was maintaining and improving their health . according to the results of many studies , maintaining\nfear of childbirth and its complications ( 28 ) , fatigue and burnout ( 28 ) , and being old ( 29 ) were the major causes of maternal concern . in this study , there were some traces of such factors among the studied women .\none of the other reasons for induced abortion was women s concerns to prevent the birth of a sick baby .\nthe mother s age at the time of pregnancy was an important reason for this concern .\nthe results of some studies have shown that per every year of increase in a woman s age , the odds ratio of the decision to perform an abortion increases by 0.08 . according to erfani ( 2010 ) , the age of around 35 years\nis associated with the highest risk of abortion ( 30 ) . in line with this finding , nikpour et al .\n( 2012 ) showed that 40.6% of induced abortions in women referred to hospitals in the south of tehran , occurred at the age of over 36 years ( 16 ) .\nin addition , in fisher s study , with increasing the age of mothers , the risk of induced abortion increased too ( 8) . usually women bear their wanted children at a young age ; in addition , with increasing women s age , their experience and knowledge of abortion and its methods increases .\nage is not only a factor affecting the abortion , but also a strong predictor of repeated cases of induced abortion .\nin other words , young women who had experienced induced abortions once are more at risk of repeat abortion . in this context\nit has been argued that the attitude and behavior towards abortion are formed and become internal at a young age . during the reproductive age , women remain stable ( 31 ) .\nconsanguineous marriage was another factor that influenced women to undergo abortion in order to prevent congenital anomaly .\nconsanguineous marriage is common in our country , although its prevalence has been reported differently in different regions .\na study on more than 300 iranian couples showed that about 38% of marriages in the country were consanguineous marriages , and about a third of them occur between cousins .\nthis type of marriage is common and even has become more prevalent due to different social and cultural factors ; for instance , people believe that consanguineous marriage results in a family s stability and has several socio - economic benefits ( 32 ) .\nthe short time interval between pregnancies was also another factor that encouraged mothers to undergo abortion to maintain their health .\nvaisi and zangeneh ( 2012 ) conducted a quantitative study in kermanshah and showed that the reluctance to have more children and the short time interval between pregnancies were the most important causes of illegal abortion in women in kermanshah ( 33 ) . according to the results of a study by mortazavi , due to the short time interval between the pregnancies , women\nmay not be physically ready for a new pregnancy ( 34 ) . in our study\n, participants reported that the time interval between pregnancies is an opportunity to recover and become ready again .\n( 2013 ) conducted a qualitative study and showed that lack of preparation and perceived weaknesses were among the main causes of unwanted pregnancy ( 35 ) . in another study\n, the researchers found that the self - efficacy score of women with a history of unwanted pregnancy was lower than other women .\nthe difference in the scores was attributed to their low levels of tolerance of pregnancy and delivery problems ( 36 ) .\nthis finding is consistent with the results of other studies in other countries and also the results of mortazavi et al.s study ( 34 , 3738 ) .\nthe second major theme in our study was the expected favorable economic outcomes resulting from the termination of pregnancy .\nsome of the participants believed that pregnancy could threaten their job position . on the other hand\n, a large number of the participants said that they underwent induced abortion to prevent the extra costs of living .\nbrown , in his study , highlighted the role of economic factors which motivate people to undergo abortion ( 28 ) .\nbased on the results of a study by visaria et al . , poverty was one of the incentives to terminate a pregnancy ( 38 ) .\nit seems that in recent years the role of economic factors on reproductive behavior have become more significant .\nof the 11 major causes of induced abortions in america , economic issue was the leading cause of abortion ( 39 ) .\nin addition , santeill et al . reported that the economic problems were the major and primary cause of induced abortion in 48.2% of cases ( 29 ) . in this study , many of the concepts and beliefs were shaped under the influence of financial problems . in all cases , where more than one factor led to the abortion , the participants reported financial problems as one of the main factors leading to induced abortion . according to the theory proposed by harvey leibeshtiene , reproductive behavior in every community is under the influence of a rational economic behavior .\naccording to this theory , economic profit or non - profit are the factors that lead the parents to decide how many children to have .\ncouples assess the costs and expenses of their children and accordingly decide on the number of children ( 40 ) .\nthe third major theme of the study was the expected favorable outcomes of induced abortion in terms of social and family relationships .\na number of participants believed that the continuation of pregnancy would affect their daily lives and interfere with many programs , such as family relations , taking care of other children , employment , and education .\nin addition , according to the results of this study , women believed that continuation of pregnancy would lead to many complications in their life , which prevented them to fulfill their own and their children s needs .\nfiner et al . reported that the major changes in women s lives ( with reference to education and occupation ) were one of three important factors motivating women to undergo abortion ( 41 ) .\nsay that some women think having a child could have a negative impact on their life as it has an interference with work and education ( 39 ) . in some studies\nwrong time  , which exacerbates women s mental readiness ; it is due to women s reluctance to disrupt their education and life programs .\nimproving family relationships , especially relationship with the husband , was one of the motives of the participants to undergo induced abortion and pregnancy termination .\nsome studies have highlighted the role of spouse or sexual partner ( as an intra - individual factor ) in making decisions and taking action to undergo induced abortion . according to brown ( 2005 ) , the most important causes for induced abortion are as follows : husbands or sexual partners insist on having induced abortion , occupational concerns , education level of the mother , and having the desired number of children ( 28 ) . in a study on american women ,\n31% of cases of induced abortion were due to factors related to the sexual partner ( 39 ) .\ninsufficient support from the husband , husband s lack of employment , addiction , and family disputes are reported as the most important factors related to the husband . although most cases of abortion can be attributed to one of the three themes mentioned above , more than half of the participants introduced a number of other factors as well .\n( 2005 ) also showed overlapping causes of abortion , especially in terms of financial resources ( 41 ) .\nnevertheless , the combination of these factors in different populations , including the population under study , is unique and different . as one of the limitations of this study , women who declined to be interviewed may have different experiences than women who volunteered to participate in the study .\nin addition , due to the illegal nature of induced abortions in iran , many experts did not consent to take part in the study because they had concerns about the legal aspects of this topic .\nin addition , in this study we did not investigate the motives of induced abortion from the viewpoints of husbands whose wives underwent an induced abortion .\nthe findings of this study indicate that a number of complex and interrelated factors may motivate a person to undergo induced abortion .\nhence , it is necessary to take intervention measures for various aspects of the phenomenon so as to prevent induced abortion and its related complications ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " introductionunsafe abortion is one of the most important health problems in many countries . because of legal and moral issues , abortion is one of the most sensitive decisions . \n the aim of this study was to understand women s expected gains from undergoing induced abortion.methodsto explain the factors leading to induced abortion , we collected the stories and experiences of a total of 21 people , including 18 women who underwent induced abortion in their most recent pregnancies , two women s health providers , and a companion of a mother who died after an induced abortion . \n this qualitative study was conducted in imam khomeini and razi hospital of ahvaz and also a number of health centers , from february to september 2014 . to collect the required data \n , we used open and semi - structured deep interviews . \n content analysis method was used to analyze the data.resultsthree major themes emerged from the analysis of the collected data , which included the following : 1 ) expected favorable health - related outcomes , 2 ) expected favorable economic outcomes , and 3 . \n expected favorable outcomes in social level and family relationships.conclusionthe results of this study showed that the studied women , to achieve to desirable outcomes in areas of health , economic and social , have undergone induced abortion . \n hence , to develop programs for the prevention of induced abortion it is necessary to consider the motivations of women to intentionally terminate a pregnancy .

old c57bl/6j mouse ( top ) and a 9-month - old dba/2j mouse ( bottom ) over a 2-hour period of anesthesia similar to that used in the mri experiments table .\nocular hypertension and the consequent diminished perfusion pressure available to drive blood through the ocular circulations is the basis for the longstanding ischemic hypothesis of glaucoma . the present study and other investigations of the dba/2j model support this hypothesis since it develops age - related ocular hypertension , reduced ocular blood flow and the rgc loss and decreased optic nerve axon density seen in human glaucoma .\nthe present study adds to the existing literature by showing that acute pharmacologic iop reduction with topical dorzolamide in the older dba/2j mouse is associated with increased retinal and choroidal blood flow .\nin addition to its hypotensive effect , dorzolamide dilates isolated retinal arterioles and so it may have a direct vasodilatory effect in vivo .\nhowever , although topical dorzolamide reaches the back of the eye , its ability to increase blood flow in the retina , choroid and optic nerve has not been shown consistently . in rabbits ,\nacute dorzolamide had no effect on choroidal perfusion , but chronic dosing increased optic nerve head perfusion in one study and had no effect in another . for humans ,\nsimilarly , for human optic nerve head blood flow , dorzolamide was reported to have no effect or to increase perfusion and to flatten the pressure - flow relationship . for human choroidal blood flow , modest increases in perfusion indexes\nthe discrepancies in the literature are likely due to differences in dosing protocols , and also the inherent ambiguities in the methods used to measure blood flow in the human ocular circulations . however , on balance , it does not appear that dorzolamide has a dramatic hyperemic effect on human retinal or choroidal blood flow .\nwhat then accounts for the blood flow responses in the present study ? as ocular blood flow could be affected by instability of systemic blood pressure over the course of the 2-hour mri experiments , we monitored arterial blood pressure over the same period outside the mri scanner .\nwe found the arterial blood pressure to be stable over 2 hours under isoflurane anesthesia , consistent with our previous results in larger cohorts of dba/2j and c57bl/6j ( n = 9 each ) during 1 hour of isoflurane anesthesia .\nthus , the changes in ocular blood flow after dz do not seem to be due to systemic blood pressure instability .\nby contrast , iop in the older dba/2j group was markedly elevated at baseline and declined markedly after dorzolamide .\nthe perfusion pressure ranges for retinal and choroidal pressure - flow autoregulation in the dba/2j mouse are unknown ; however , the perfusion pressure below which retinal and choroidal blood flow respond linearly to perfusion pressure changes is approximately 40 mm hg in several species .\nassuming the perfusion pressure was below the autoregulatory cut - off pressure in the older dba/2j mice at baseline , it is plausible that the increase in perfusion pressure when iop decreased after dz would cause the observed increases in retinal and choroidal blood flow .\nfor the younger dba/2j group and the c57bl/6j group , the interpretation of the retinal and choroidal blood flow response pattern is less clear . at baseline ,\ntheir iops were similar and relatively low , and did not fall markedly after dorzolamide .\nthus , iop does not explain the reduced baseline retinal blood flow and marginally reduced ( p = 0.07 by unpaired t - test ) choroidal blood flow in the younger dba/2j group , nor does iop explain the fall in choroidal blood flow in the second hour after dorzolamide .\nthe differences in baseline retinal and choroidal blood flows may be due to arterial pressure .\narterial pressures in conscious c57bl/6j and dba/2j mice are similar and around 100 mm hg . under isoflurane anesthesia ,\narterial pressure may fall lower in dba/2j mice than c57bl/6j mice , as suggested by the two animals we tested ( fig .\n4 ) ; higher iop and low arterial pressure would obviously contribute to the even lower baseline retinal and choroidal blood flows in the older dba/2j mice .\nhowever , the fall in choroidal blood flow in the dba/2j and c57bl/6j during the second hour after dorzolamide can not be explained by perfusion pressure .\na possible explanation is washout of an endogenous vasodilator during the first hour hyperemia , but this is speculative .\nthis study investigated the effects of acute topical application of dorzolamide on iop and retinal and choroidal blood flow in an animal model of glaucoma .\nthe results support the hypothesis that acute topical dorzolamide decreases intraocular pressure and increases retinal and choroidal blood flow in the older dba/2j mouse model of glaucoma .\nfuture studies will investigate the effects of chronic dorzolamide treatment on retinal and choroidal blood flow in young and old dba/2j mice ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " purposeto test the hypothesis that acute topical dorzolamide ( dz ) decreases intraocular pressure ( iop ) and increases retinal and choroidal blood flow in the dba/2j mouse model of glaucoma.methodsretinal and choroidal blood flow were measured in 4- and 9-month -

pathogen interface is an essential step towards our understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving bacterial adhesion .\nultimately , this will help us to identify strategies to interfere with these processes during infections . in conducting such studies ,\nwe often face a dilemma : biochemical and biophysical analysis of the molecular mechanisms of adhesin binding requires their separation from other cell wall components , which may interfere with adhesion events . on the other hand ,\nthe use of recombinant soluble proteins over - simplifies the adhesion event , by disregarding protein anchoring in the bacterial cell wall and multivalency of binding achieved through bacterial surface display .\nequally , from the host cell s perspective , encountering and binding to single adhesin molecules does not always have the same impact in terms of plasma membrane organization , membrane fluidity and receptor clustering and this , ultimately , makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of adhesion on host cellular signaling and the outcome of bacteria - host interactions .  \nrecently a method was devised , whereby recombinant purified adhesins or adhesin fragments are directionally and covalently coupled to polymer particles similar in size to bacteria , thus mimicking bacterial surface display .\nthis approach has been used on a range of different adhesins , from gram - negative multivalent adhesion molecules ( mams ) , to gram - positive adhesins including staphylococcus aureus fibronectin binding protein ( fnbpa ) and streptococcus pyogenes f1 .\nthis method has allowed the dissection of adhesin fragments important for host cell binding , identification of host surface receptors and determination of their behavior on the host cell surface , while taking both binding affinity and avidity into consideration .\nadditionally , this approach has been used to investigate the efficacy of immobilized adhesins and derivatives as inhibitors of host - pathogen interactions .\nit has been demonstrated that surface coupled derivatives of the vibrio parahaemolyticus multivalent adhesion molecule ( mam ) 7 can be used to attenuate a range of bacterial infections in vitro , including those caused by multidrug - resistant pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin - resistant s. aureus ( mrsa ) .   herein , we describe different chemistries which can be used to immobilize adhesins to commercially available functionalized polystyrene particles . due to the wide array of available surface functionalities , labels and particle sizes , these are a useful scaffold for the production of bacteriomimetic materials to investigate adhesin - host interactions .\nwe further describe methods for the initial characterization of the coupling reaction , and for the calculation of important properties of the resulting materials .\nfinally , the use of bead - coupled adhesins as competitive inhibitors of in vitro bacterial infections is discussed as an example of their application , as well as the future scope and limitations of this approach .\nthiol - amine directional coupling note : this protocol is suitable for coupling of cysteine containing proteins to amine -

visualized using rhodamine - phalloidin to stain for f - actin ( figure 5b ) .\nfigure 5 . preparation and use of fluorophore labeled biomimetic beads for imaging purposes.(a ) suspension of fluorescent blue biomimetic beads ( right tube , 10x stock ) and buffer control ( left tube ) .\n( b ) attachment of mam7-coupled beads to hela cells results in actin rearrangements and stress fiber formation .\nattachment of fluorescent blue beads and resulting actin stress fibers ( red , stained with rhodamine - phalloidin ) were imaged by microscopy .\nbar , 10 m . images in panel b were adapted from lim et al . and reproduced under the creative commons attribution license\nherein , we describe two protocols , which can be used to couple thiol - containing proteins to amine- or carboxylate - modified polystyrene beads , respectively . due to ease of the procedure ,\nthiol - amine coupling is preferable , but depending on the desired bead specification ( diameter , fluorescence properties ) , use of amine - functionalized beads may not be possible and we have therefore included a protocol which will convert the carboxylate- into an amine moiety to give the researcher the greatest possible flexibility in choice of scaffold . although both thiol - amine and thiol - carboxyl coupling work for any cysteine containing protein , directional coupling ( i.e. , immobilization of the protein per its n - terminus , mimicking surface display ) requires a protein without cysteine residues , that is produced as a gst fusion protein , or that contains a single terminal cysteine residue introduced by site directed mutagenesis .\nif multiple reactive cysteines are contained within the protein , this will lead to random immobilization which may impede protein function .\nthese may be removed by site directed mutagenesis , although this would require extensive assays to ensure native structure and function are retained in the mutant . for gst fusion proteins ,\npurified gst - tag coupled to beads can be used as a suitable negative control .\nusing uncoupled beads as a control should be avoided , as these often have a higher tendency to clump together or adhere to cells non - specifically . a simplified version of protocol 1.2 .\n, using only edc , can be used to couple proteins to carboxyl - functionalized polymer beads , however in this case coupling takes place via primary amines in the protein and therefore does not guarantee directional coupling .\ntcep as a reducing agent must not be replaced with other commercially available and commonly used reducing agents , such as dithiothreitol ( dtt ) or 2-mercaptoethanol ( bme ) , as the thiols contained within them will compete with protein coupling in the thiol - maleimide coupling step .\npbs may be replaced with other buffers , but with the following considerations : buffers may not contain primary amines ( so tris - containing buffers are not suitable ) .\nuse of buffers containing very low ( < 10 mm ) salt concentrations leads to bead clumping and should also be avoided .\nprotein purity is also an important factor to consider during this procedure , and to achieve high quality data , pure proteins should be used .\nwe routinely purify proteins in multiple steps , including at least an affinity purification and gel filtration step , but in some cases ion exchange chromatography is done as a third step . as a result the purity of proteins used for coupling is usually 90% or higher , as judged by sds - page .\nit is recommended to determine protein concentrations both in the initial reaction mixture as well as of the supernatant after reaction completion .\nthis will help to determine the apparent concentration of bead - coupled protein , and thus coupling density .\nthis can be taken into account when preparing the initial protein solution in subsequent reactions , to achieve the desired final concentration and coupling density .\nbradford reagent is particularly suited for determination of protein concentration before and after the coupling reaction , as none of the substances in the reaction interferes with the dye complex formation at the concentrations used .\nif lower protein concentrations are to be used , this method may have to be replaced by a more sensitive detection method , however attention has to be paid to the fact it has to be compatible with the substances contained within the coupling reaction .\nit is also recommended to use freshly prepared reagents and handle powdered reagents with care ( e.g. , store in a sealed container and use silica beads , to avoid the reagents drawing moisture ) since the quality of reagents will influence the coupling efficiency .\nif the coupling efficiency is lower than expected , possible remedies include increasing the initial bead and protein concentrations .\nif higher concentrations are being used , the concentration of coupling reagents has to be increased proportionally to ensure sufficient molar excess .\nmodifying bead / protein concentrations is usually a better step towards optimization rather than increasing reaction times . since the protocols for bead coupling are lengthy , we commonly prepare a large batch of material .\naliquots of the suspension can be snap - frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -20 c for several months . thawed aliquots\nshould not be refrozen and should be kept at 4 c and used within 1 - 2 days .\nhowever , this will vary with the nature and stability of the protein used as should be tested on a small batch initially .\nthis protocol described an assay that is commonly used to measure inhibition of bacterial binding and pathogen - mediated cytotoxicity on host cells .\nthe assay is commonly performed to measure the capacity of bead - coupled mams to competitively inhibit infection of hela epithelial cells with the sea - food borne pathogen vibrio parahaemolyticus , using either a decrease in bacterial attachment to host cells or reduced cytotoxicity as a read - out . in both cases , preparation and competition assays follow the same protocol . depending on the readout ,\ndifferent strains of v. parahaemolyticus are being used : the cytotoxic strain por1 is used for cytotoxicity measurements , while the non - cytotoxic strain por2 is used for measuring bacterial adhesion , since cell death and cell detachment compromises the procedure for quantifying attached bacteria .\ninitially , competition experiments were set up as a step - wise protocol , where host cells were first pre - incubated with beads prior to the addition of bacteria . for v. parahaemolyticus and\nthe bead specifications used ( 2 m beads coupled to mam7 ) , both beads and bacteria can be added at the same time without changes in the resulting cytotoxicity .\ni.e. , in this experimental setup , beads outcompete bacteria for host cell binding . depending on the bacterial species and bead geometry used , there may be good reasons for maintaining the bead adhesion and bacterial infection as two separate steps .\nfor example , to infect cells with non - motile bacteria , plates are commonly centrifuged after addition of the infection media .\nhowever , centrifugation of plates containing bead suspensions should be avoided , since this leads to a highly uneven distribution of beads on the cell layer .\nif smaller particle sizes are being used , beads will take longer to settle on the cell surface , in which case sufficient time should be allowed for bead attachment prior to the infection .\nwhen bacterial adhesion is used as a read out , samples should be taken at time points where host cells are not significantly damaged by the infecting strain , as cell detachment and lysis can compromise the quantification of attached bacteria . instead of enumerating bacterial adhesion by dilution plating\n, samples may alternatively be processed for imaging ( figure 5 ) . in this case\n, tissue culture cells should be seeded onto glass cover slips , rather than directly into wells .\nadditionally , fluorescent beads and bacteria expressing a fluorescent protein may be used , along with infection - specific host cell markers .\nfor example , competition experiments are commonly imaged using fluorescent red rhodamine - phalloidin to stain the host cells actin cytoskeleton and assess morphological changes resulting from infection , together with fluorescent blue beads and fluorescent green ( gfp expressing or syto18 stained ) bacteria .\na range of bead - coupled adhesins , including staphylococcus aureus fnbpa , streptococcus pyogenes f1 fud and vibrio parahaemolyticus mam , have been used as biomimetic materials to study adhesion , adhesion inhibition and the contribution of adhesion to pathogen - mediated cytotoxicity .\none of the advantages of using this approach is the ease of visualization of attachment events , since the polymer beads used as scaffolds are available in a wide range of colors ( e.g. , blue , fluorescent red , blue , green , orange ) .\nthus , direct protein labeling , which may interfere with function , can be avoided .\nadditionally , surface coupling mimics the multivalent display of adhesins on the bacterial surface , thus reflecting a more physiologically relevant conformation compared to soluble proteins .\ncompared to studies using intact bacteria or bacterial mutants , the bead approach circumvents problems associated with bacterial growth .\nfor example , longer - term ( e.g. , o / n ) studies of bacterial adhesion to host cells using intact bacteria are often compromised by phenomena accompanying bacterial growth \nacidification of the growth medium and nutrient depletion negatively affect host cells , and bacterial replication eventually compromises imaging quality .\nmore recently , the use of bead - coupled adhesins has been extended to include their use as tools for affinity purifications of host cellular factors involved in signaling processes downstream of bacterial attachment .\nv. parahaemolyticus mam7 , via binding to phosphatidic acids in the host cell membrane , triggers rhoa activation and actin rearrangements .\nmam - coupled beads are being used to purify and identify proteins involved in the signaling platforms assembled as a consequence of mam - host cell binding . since\nbeads can easily be separated from the supernatant by a short centrifugation step , and the protein of interest is covalently coupled , this is a good method to achieve separation from contaminant proteins and enrich relevant protein complexes , which can be used for downstream applications such as proteomics or western blotting ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " bacterial attachment to host cells is one of the earliest events during bacterial colonization of host tissues and thus a key step during infection . \n the biochemical and functional characterization of adhesins mediating these initial bacteria - host interactions is often compromised by the presence of other bacterial factors , such as cell wall components or secreted molecules , which interfere with the analysis . \n this protocol describes the production and use of biomimetic materials , consisting of pure recombinant adhesins chemically coupled to commercially available , functionalized polystyrene beads , which have been used successfully to dissect the biochemical and functional interactions between individual bacterial adhesins and host cell receptors . \n protocols for different coupling chemistries , allowing directional immobilization of recombinant adhesins on polymer scaffolds , and for assessment of the coupling efficiency of the resulting  bacteriomimetic  \n materials are also discussed . \n we further describe how these materials can be used as a tool to inhibit pathogen mediated cytotoxicity and discuss scope , limitations and further applications of this approach in studying bacterial -

positive bacteria ; however the compound 41 lacks the monoamine oxidase a inhibition and inhibits cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) due to its poor solubility .\nliu et al . have reported novel substituted oxotriazolylphenyl derivatives . of the many compounds described , the compound 42 ( figure 25 ) has shown potent antibacterial activity against pathogens staphylococcus epidermidis , streptococcus pneumoniae , streptococcus enteritidis , and streptococcus nonhemolyticus at 0.106.25  g / ml   o vara prasad et al . have reported new series of oxazolidinones with c5 carboxamide functionality , that is , reverse amides , which blocks the bacterial protein synthesis .\nthese compounds have also exhibited less potency against monoamine oxidase enzymes , indicative for the lower side effects .\nthe compound 43 ( figure 25 ) has shown reduction of myelotoxicity in a 14-day safety study in rodents and compared with linezolid .  \nrudra et al . have reported series of heterocyclic oxazolidinones as antibacterial agents with identification of rbx 8700 as potent compound .\nsystematic modification of the linker between the five - membered heterocycle and the piperazinyl ring of rbx 7644 and its thienyl analogue 44 ( figure 25 ) resulted in the identification of an expanded spectrum compound .  \n\nreck et al . reported novel acyclic substituted ( pyridin-3-yl ) phenyl oxazolidinones 4547   ( figure 25 ) .\nthe acyclic 6-substituted pyridin-3-yl phenyl oxazolidinones 46 and 47 having bulky substituent demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity against gram - positive organisms , including linezolid resistant streptococcus pneumonia ( 1.0  g / ml ) .\nthe compounds with bulkier substituents showed reduced mao - a activity ( ki = 40  m ; ki = 19  m ) compared to the corresponding unsubstituted parent compound 48 ( figure 25 ) ( ki < 0.3  m ) and the improved solubility .  \nthe high - molecular - weight novel oxazolidinone derivatives having variations in the regions b , c , and at the c5 side chain have been patented by a group of scientists from ferrer international company .\nmorphochem ag has published a patent mentioning oxazolidinone - quinolone hybrid 49 ( figure 26 ) .\nfurther , in another report they have described different variant of oxazolidinone - quinolone hybrids of type 50 .\nthe disclosed derivatives 50 ( figure 26 ) possess the pharmacophore of quinolone and oxazolidinone linked together through a linker and the hybrid has been used as an antibacterial agent .\nhowever , there is no mention of the antibacterial activities for the disclosed oxazolidinone - quinolone hybrids .\nextensive studies on the syntheses of oxazolidinone antibacterial agents and their sar have been reported ; however only few qsar studies have been published .\nthe first qsar study was reported in the year 1999 , comprised a 3d - qsar study on a small data sets of two novel series of oxazolidinone antibacterial agents using  comparative molecular field analysis \n( comfa ) , wherein a training set of 17 compounds with two reference compounds have been used .\nthe comfa steric , electrostatic fields , and clogp were used as descriptors , and the activities against methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus 88 ( mrsa 88 ) as dependents were developed . the cross - validated r2cv ( 0.653 ) and conventional r2 ( 0.984 ) from the partial least square ( pls ) and comfa analyses indicated considerable reliability for predicting the antibacterial activities of oxazolidinone antibacterial agents .  \nthe second 3d - qsar studies , reported by karki and kulkarni in the year 2001 , used a genetic function algorithm with a data set of 60 compounds .\nthe qsar models were developed using a training set of 50 compounds and the in vitro mic against staphylococcus aureus sfco-1 .\nthe predictive ability of the qsar model was evaluated with a test set of 10 compounds .\nthe results obtained concluded that the antibacterial activity of the 3-aryloxazolidin-2-ones is strongly dependent on the electronic factor as expressed by lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy ( lumo ) and the spatial factor as expressed by density and thermodynamic factors accounted for molar refractivity and the heat of formation .\nrevealed that the antibacterial activity against gram - positive bacteria including methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin - resistant enterococci on 5 thiocarbonyl oxazolidinones was significantly affected by the lipophilicity , especially the calculated log p value , the balance between 5-hydrophilic ( or hydrophobic ) substituents and hydrophobic ( or hydrophilic ) substituents on the benzene ring ( table 2 ) .\nthe development of resistance by the antibiotics in the gram - positive pathogenic bacteria over the last twenty years and continuing today has created a need for new antibiotic classes , which may be unaffected by existing bacterial resistance .\nthe oxazolidin-2-ones not only represent a new class with a novel mechanism of action , but also satisfy the requirement for overcoming the resistance mechanisms .\nboth linezolid and eperezolid , the first chemical candidates , arose from the piperazine subclass , with the first one being chosen further development because of its enhanced pharmacokinetic properties .\nthe main attractive traits of the oxazolidinone series have encouraged further work in the area , and the patent literature reveals that extensive chemical investigation is currently being made . the unexpected early resistance development emphasizes the need for further exploration of features of the oxazolidinone to eliminate these deficiencies .\nrecently , several changes , involving the c5 side chain as well the n - phenyl heterocyclic ring , give promise for such improvement .\nlinezolid is an oxazolidinone developed by pharmacia ( formerly pharmacia & upjohn ) for the treatment of multiresistant gram - positive infections 187765 , 317456 .\nlinezolid resistance due to a 23s rrna mutation may emerge in enterococci during therapy with this antimicrobial and may be associated with clinical failure 368652 . following fda approval , linezolid was launched in may 2000 368526 , 368652 . in april 2000 , the fda approved linezolid injection , tablets , and oral suspension for the treatment of patients with infections caused by gram - positive bacteria .\nit is indicated for adults in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia , community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) , complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and vancomycin - resistant enterococcus ( vre ) infections caused by methicillin - resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mrsa ) , vre , faecium and penicillin - susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae 363503 .\nvancomycin resistance was reported in only 0.6 and 3.0% of enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium , respectively .\npenicillin resistance occurred in 25.1% of streptococcus pneumonia , 4.9% at the high level ( 2  mg\nthe mic90 for linezolid was 1  mg / l for streptococci and 2  mg / l for enterococci and staphylococci . using the us fda- and eucast - recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid\n, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) , 8  mg / l\n. the distribution of linezolid mic values was unimodal and varied between 0.25 and 1  mg / l for streptococci ( > 90% of isolates ) and between 1 and 2  mg / l for staphylococci ( > 90% ) and enterococci ( > 95% ) .\nfavorable clinical results shown by linezolid prompted many pharmaceutical industries and academic institutions to explore the possibilities of expansion of antibacterial spectrum of this class .\na large number of publications , reviews , and patents testify to the interest of the various research groups in the oxazolidinone class of antibacterials .\nfurazolidone as shown in figure 27 is the first member of the oxazolidinone class discovered in 1950 and appears to be the initial candidate responsible for the genesis of further work on oxazolidinone antibacterials .\nyc-20   ( figure 28 ) and linezolid were active against all gram - positive organisms isolated , including strains resistant to other classes of antibiotics .\nthe present study confirms and expands previous findings of the good in vitro activity of yc-20 against gram - positive organisms .\nyc-20 has a potential role in the treatment of infections caused by gram - positive pathogens , especially for multidrug - resistant gram - positive bacteria ( table 3 ) .  \nradezolid ( rx-1741 ) [ 56 , 57 ] ( figure 28 ) is a novel oxazolidinone with broader spectrum of coverage and increased activity against gram - positive organisms as compared to other oxazolidinones .\nradezolid has recently completed successfully two phase 2 clinical trials : one for community - acquired pneumonia ( cap ) and the second for uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections ( usssi ) ( table 4 ) . \n\nthe spectrum of activity of torezolid ( tr-700 ) ( figure 28 ) , the active moiety of torezolid phosphate ( tr-701 ) , and proposes tentative mic and disk diffusion breakpoints as well as quality control ranges .\nthe in vitro susceptibilities of 1,096 bacterial isolates , representing 23 different species or phenotypic groups , were determined for torezolid , linezolid , cefotaxime , and levofloxacin using clinical and laboratory standards institute ( clsi ) broth microdilution mics , minimum bactericidal concentrations ( mbcs ) , agar dilution , and disk diffusion testing methods .\ntorezolid was very active against the majority of gram - positive strains , including methicillin - susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus ( mic50 = 0.25  g / ml , mic90 0.5  g / ml ) , coagulase - negative staphylococci ( cns ; mic50 = 0.25  g / ml , mic90 0.5  g / ml ) , enterococci ( mic50 and mic90 0.5  g / ml ) , and streptococci ( mic50 and mic90 0.25  g / ml ) . based upon mic90 s , torezolid was 4-fold more active than linezolid against s. aureus , coagulase - negative staphylococci , and the enterococci and 8-fold more active than linezolid . in 2002 astrazeneca introduced posizolid ( azd2563 ) ( figure 28 ) .\nresults indicate that posizolid has excellent , targeted bactericidal activity against all common gram - positive bacteria , regardless of resistance to other classes of antibiotics .\nthe in vitro activity of azd2563 , a novel oxazolidinone , was assessed against 595 gram - positive cocci , comprising recent surveillance isolates and a collection of resistant ( including multiresistant ) , epidemiologically diverse isolates .\nthe mics of azd2563 for staphylococci , pneumococci , and enterococci had narrow ranges , 0.252  mg / l , with modal mics of 1  mg / l for staphylococci and pneumococci , and 12  mg /\nazd2563 was equally active against the surveillance isolates and those that had been selected for their multiresistance to other agents .\nthe mics of azd2563 were either the same as those of linezolid or twofold lower .\na few mannich ketones of piperazinyl oxazolidinone derivatives have been synthesized and their antibacterial activities in various gram - positive organisms such as bacillus subtilis , staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus epidermidis , and enterococcus faecalis were evaluated by mic determination .\nthus in an attempt to improve potency , we prepared several analogues by modifying the ketone part a. however , all such resulting compounds lost their in - vitro antibacterial activity .\nit has been reported that thioacetamide at the 5th position of the oxazolidinone improves the activity .\nmic was determined by microbroth dilution technique and values reported in table represent the highest mic value obtained in triplicate .\ns.a1 , staphylococcus aureus zyabl 006 ; s.a2 , staphylococcus aureus atcc 33591 ; s.e , staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228 , b.s , bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 ; e.f , enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212 .\nthe compound library ( figure 28 ) was screened using a disk diffusion assay on the gram - positive bacterial reference strains , m. smegmatis atcc 14468 , bacillus subtilis atcc 6633 , and enterococcus faecalis atcc .\nmycobacterium smegmatis was inoculated into middlebrook 7h9 containing 0.2% glycerol and adc enrichment while the other strains were inoculated into mueller \nthe inocula of all strains were allowed to incubate for approximately 24  h at 37c and 180  rpm .\nminimum inhibitory concentrations ( mics ) of compound was also determined against the same strains using a broth macrodilution assay using either middlebrook 7h9 containing 0.2% glycerol and adc enrichment or mueller  hinton broth 20 .\nthe highest concentration for each compound tested was 32 lg / ml , and each subsequent tube was a twofold dilution of the previous .\nthe m. smegmatis tubes were incubated for 48  h at 37c while the other strains were incubated for 24  h and then analyzed .\nthiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide ( mtt ) was dissolved in meoh ( 10  mg / ml ) and added to the solution ( 20 ll ) to aid in bacteria visualization .\nthe in vitro antibacterial activities of the compound and vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , and linezolid as the reference drugs were determined by the conventional agar dilution method using mueller  hinton agar medium .\nthe tested gram - positive organisms included two clinical isolates of s. aureus resistant to methicillin ( mrsa ) , s. aureus atcc 29737 , and s. epidermidis atcc 12229 .\ngram - negative bacteria used in the study were e. coli atcc 8739 , s. typhimurium atcc 1639 and p.\nthe tested compounds , vancomycin and ciprofloxacin , were dissolved in dmso while linezolid was dissolved in water .\nsuspensions of each of bacteria were prepared to contain approximately 106 colony - forming units ( cfu / ml ) and applied to plates with twofold serially diluted compounds to be tested in distilled water in concentration ranging from 0.01 to 100  mg / ml and incubated at 37c for 18  h. to ensure that the solvent had no effect on bacterial growth , a control test was performed with test medium supplemented with dmso at the same dilution as used in the experiments .\nhinton ( mh ) agar with medium containing dilutions of antibacterial agents ranging from 0.12 to 64  mg / ml . the test compounds were dissolved in 20% water in dmso , while linezolid and vancomycin were dissolved in 40% water in ethanol and water , respectively .\nthe tests were performed using mh agar plates for all staphylococci and enterococci and on mh agar plates supplemented with 5% sheep blood to facilitate the growth of s. pneumoniae , h. influenzae , and m. catarrhalis .\nthe gram - positive clinical isolates utilized in this study consisted of methicillin - resistant s. aureus ( mrsa , n = 1/4  10 ) , methicillin - susceptible s. aureus ( mssa , n = 1/4 10 ) , methicillin - resistant coagulase - negative staphylococci ( mr - cns , n = 1/4 3 ) , methicillin - sensitive coagulase - negative staphylococci ( ms - cns , n = 1/4 6 ) , s. pneumoniae ( n = 1/4  3 ) , vancomycin - sensitive ( vse , n = 1/4  6 ) and vancomycin - resistant ( vre ,  n = 1/4  4 ) enterococci . the gram - negative clinical isolates tested included h. influenzae ( n = 1/4  4 ) and m. catarrhalis ( n = 1/4  1 ) .\nthe reference strains , s. aureus atcc 25923 , s. epidermidis atcc 12228 and e. faecalis atcc 29212 , e. coli atcc 25922 , and h. influenzae atcc 49247 were used as controls .\nthe final bacterial concentration for inocula was 107  cfu / ml and was incubated at 35c for 18  h. the test compounds were also evaluated against s. aureus attc 25923 in mh broth supplemented with 50% human plasma to assess the extent of plasma binding and/or plasma instability .\nthe mic was defined as the lowest drug concentration that completely inhibited growth of the bacteria . against some of the gram - positive bacteria strains\ntested , the triazole oxazolidinone ( figure 28 ) ph-027 demonstrated mic values comparable to or 1- to 2-fold lower that hose of linezolid and vancomycin .\nin particular , the mic values of ph-027 against vancomycin susceptible e. faecium ( vse ) , vancomycin - intermediate - resistant e. faecalis ( vire ) , and vancomycin - resistant e. faecalis ( vre ) were 0.5 , 0.5 , and 2  mg / ml , respectively , compared to an mic of 2  mg / ml demonstrated by linezolid against these strains .\nhowever , the mic 's of vancomycin against the same strains were 4 , 8 and > 32  mg / ml , respectively .\nph-027 demonstrated the most potent antibacterial activity against both sensitive and resistant gram - positive bacteria strains , including mrsa , mssa , ms - cns , mr - cns , prsp , and enterococci ( enterococcus faecium and enterococcus faecalis ) .  \nthe result of in vitro antibacterial activity against a spectrum of resistant and susceptible gram - positive organisms   clearly shows that all compounds ( figure 29 ) bearing sulfonyl group have good antibacterial activity .\nobviously , the introduction of strong electron - withdrawing groups ( e.g. , cf3 , f , and no2 ) into the oxazolidinones can confer excellent antibacterial activity especially at the 3rd position of the phenylsulfonyl group , in addition , electron - donating groups ( e.g. , cl ) . ( 2 ) anticoagulant activity [ 67 , 68 ] . rivaroxaban ( bay 597939 ) ( figure 30 ) is an oral anticoagulant invented and manufactured by bayer ; in a number of countries it is marketed as xarelto .\nif approved by the united states fda , it will be marketed by ortho - mcneil pharmaceutical .\nrivaroxaban is well absorbed from the gut and maximum inhibition of factor xa occurs four hours after a dose .\nthe effect lasts 812 hours , but factor xa activity does not return to normal within 24 hours so once daily dosing is possible .   \n( 3 ) antitubercular activity . during the course of investigation in the oxazolidinones antibacterial agent area\nthe salient structural feature of these oxazolidinone analogues , u-100480 , u-101603 , and u-101244 , is their appended thiomorpholine .\npotent activity against a screening strain of m. tuberculosis was determined by u-100480 and u-101603 ( mic = 0.125  mg / ml ) .\nthe activities of linezolid , eperezolid , and pnu-100480 were evaluated in a murine model of tuberculosis . approximately 10 ( 7 ) viable mycobacterium tuberculosis atcc 35801 organisms were given intravenously to 4-week - old outbred cd-1 mice .\nin the first study , treatment was started 1 day postinfection and was given by gavage for 4 weeks .\na dose - response study was performed with pnu-100480 and linezolid ( both at 25 , 50 , and 100  mg / kg of body weight ) .\npnu-100480 was more active than linezolid , and its efficacy increased with an escalation of the dose .\nsubsequently , the activity of pnu-100480 alone and in combination with rifampin or isoniazid was evaluated and was compared to that of isoniazid - rifampin .\nthe activity of pnu-100480 was similar to that of isoniazid and/or rifampin in the various combinations tested .\nfurther evaluation of these oxazolidinones in the murine test system would be useful prior to the development of clinical studies with humans .  \nmonoamine oxidase ( mao ) inhibitors were developed as antidepressants but many drugs , including the novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents , share similar molecular properties and have mao inhibitory activity .\nfactors important for binding antidepressants and modifications to decrease binding of oxazolidinones to avoid undesirable vascular effects are discussed .   in man ,\nthe antidepressant agent 3-(3-methylphenyl)-5-hydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone ( toloxatone ) ( figure 30 ) on oral dosing was mainly eliminated in urine ( 80% dose in 12  h ) .\nplasma concnentration of total radioactivity was max ( 5.8  g equiv./ml ) at 30  min to 1  h after administration and declined rapidly ( t1/2 , 1.25  h ) .\nunchanged drug accounted for 48 , 32 , and 13% of plasma radioactivity at 15  min , 1  h , and 6  h , respectively .\na minor urinary metabolite , characterized as a phenolic derivative , was also excreted conjugated .   on the basis of previous laboratory studies as-8 ( 5-morpholinemethyl-3-(4-chlorobenzylideneamino)-2-oxazolidinone )\nwas suggested to possess antidepressant - like activity . forced swim test , learned helplessness , and conflict vogel 's test were performed after three prior administrations of as-8 ( 24 , 5 , and 1  h before the test ) .\nthe data have shown that as-8 produces moderate antidepressant effect but did not induce anxiolytic - like action .\nthe combined treatment of rats with as-8 ( 100  mg / kg ) and amitriptyline ( 5  mg / kg ) or desipramine ( 1.25  mg / kg ) significantly stimulated active behavior in the forced swim test above the level obtained with each of the drug given separately .\nthe present data suggest the potential antidepressant efficacy of as-8 in conjunction with small doses of tricyclic antidepressants .  \n( s)- and ( r)-3-dodecanoyl-4-phosphatidylcholinohydroxymethyl-2-oxazolidinone ( 1 ) ( figure 30 ) , which are cyclic analogues of the amide phospholipid 7 , were synthesized .\nthe inhibitory activities of these analogues toward phospholipase a2 were compared with that of the amide analogue 7 .\nthe inhibitory activities of these analogues toward phospholipase a2 were compared with that of the amide analogue .  \n5-methyl-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-3-phenylamino-2,4-oxazolidinedione , dpx - je874 , is a new agricultural fungicide under development by dupont .\ndpx - je874 is a member of a new class of oxazolidinone fungicides which demonstrate excellent control of plant pathogens in the ascomycete , basidiomycete , and oomycete classes which infect grapes , cereals , tomatoes , potatoes , and other crops .\nthe synthesis , mode of action , and structure - activity relationships of two types of oxazolidinones , 2-thioxo-4-oxazolidinones and 2,4-oxazolidinediones , were discussed .\nfamoxadone ( 3-anilino-5-methyl-5-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1 , 3-oxazolidine-2 , 4-dione ) ( figure 30 ) , is a new agricultural fungicide recently commercialized by dupont under the trade name famoxate .\nfamoxadone is a member of a new class of oxazolidinone fungicides that demonstrate excellent control of plant pathogens in the ascomycete , basidiomycete , and oomycete classes that infect grapes , cereals , tomatoes , potatoes , and other crops .\nthe molecule and its oxazolidinone analogs are potent inhibitors of mitochondrial ubiquinol : cytochrome c oxidoreductase ( cytochrome bc1 ) and they bind in the q0 site of the enzyme near the low potential heme of cytochrome b. inhibitor binding constants for five mutant cytochrome bc1 enzymes from saccharomyces cerevisiae having single amino acid changes in their apocytochrome b located near the low potential heme were compared with their two parental wild - type enzymes .\nthe five individual amino acid changes altered the inhibition constants for the inhibitors famoxadone , myxothiazol , azoxystrobin , and kresoxim - methyl in dissimilar fashion .  \na method of treating central nervous system diseases and disorders , the diseases and disorders being responsive to drugs possessing psychotropic activity .\nthe method involves administering to a subject suffering from the disease or disorder a therapeutically effective amount of 5-morpholinomethyl-3-(4-chlorobenzylideneamine)-2-oxazolidinone or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of 5-morpholinomethyl-3-(4-chlorobenzylideneamine)-2-oxazolidinone .\nthe invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition , the composition having pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and 5-morpholinomethyl-3-(4-chlorobenzylideneamine)-2-oxazolidinone and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of 5-morpholinomethyl-3-(4-chlorobenzylideneamine)-2-oxazolidinone .  \nthe severity of anaemic decerebrate rigidity was quantitatively determined by measuring the frequency of electromyographic potentials in the rat .\nsome oxazolidinones markedly reduced the severity of this decerebrate rigidity in a dose - dependent manner , ( 4s,5r)-4-(2-methylpropyl)-3-[3-(perhydroazepin-1-yl)propyl]-5-phenyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one ( mlv-6976 ) being the most potent .\nin addition to the oxazolidinones , an amino alcohol derivative , ( 1rs,2sr)-5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-(3-piperidinopropylamino)hexan-1-ol(mlv-5860 ) also reduced the rat decerebrate rigidity . in the oxazolidinone series ,\nthe optical isomers with absolute configuration ( s ) at the 4-position were more potent than the corresponding ( 4r)-isomers , while there was no significant difference in their ld50 values .\nnormal rats and mice receiving mlv-6976 at doses which reduced decerebrate rigidity showed no behavioural changes , impairment of motor coordination only appearing at extremely high doses .\nmlv-6976 reduced the severity of harmaline - induced tremor in mice in a dose - dependent manner , but slightly augmented tremorine - induced tremor .\nthe frequency of the spike discharges induced by iontophoretically applied glutamate was reduced by mlv-6976 in a dose - dependent manner in rat cortical neurones .\nthe amplitude of miniature endplate potentials of the rat diaphragm was decreased by mlv-6976 only at concentrations greater than 0.1  mm .\nit is concluded that mlv-6976 acts on the brainstem or / and higher levels of the brain rather than on the spinal cord or the peripheral nervous system to reduce the excessive activities of the nervous system .  \n5-vinyloxazolidine-2-thione ( vot ) administered orally to lactating rats was found to be efficiently transferred to the sucklings via the milk . in mothers\nthe exposure to vot resulted in an increased percentage of neutrophils , a decreased percentage of lymphocytes , and increases in the relative weights of liver and thyroid .\nsuckling rats showed a decreased number of leucocytes , increases in the relative weights of liver and thyroid and structural changes in the thyroid .\nrs -

increasing number of multidrug - resistant bacteria . in this study\nthis antibiotic family is distinguished by having in vitro and in vivo activity against hospital - acquired , as well as community - acquired , pathogens .\nwe compared the 50s ribosome binding affinity of this family to that of the only marketed oxazolidinone antibiotic , linezolid , using chloramphenicol and puromycin competition binding assays .\nthe competition assays demonstrated that several members of the r-01 family displace , more effectively than linezolid , compounds known to bind to the ribosomal a site .\nwe also monitored binding by assessing whether r-01 compounds protect u2585 ( escherichia coli numbering ) , a nucleotide that influences peptide bond formation and peptide release , from chemical modification by carbodiimide .\nthe r-01 oxazolidinones were able to inhibit translation of ribosomes isolated from linezolid - resistant staphylococcus aureus at submicromolar concentrations .\nconsistent with their ribosomal a - site targeting and greater potency , the r-01 compounds promote nonsense suppression and frameshifting to a greater extent than linezolid .\nimportantly , the gain in potency does not impact prokaryotic specificity as , like linezolid , the members of the r-01 family show translation 50% inhibitory concentrations that are at least 100-fold higher for eukaryotic than for prokaryotic ribosomes .\nhilliard et al . have reported rwj-416457 is an investigational pyrrolopyrazolyl - substituted oxazolidinone with activity against antibiotic - susceptible and -resistant gram - positive pathogens .\nefficacies of rwj-416457 , linezolid , and vancomycin against methicillin - susceptible staphylococcus aureus ( mssa ) and community - associated methicillin - resistant s. aureus ( ca - mrsa ) in murine skin and systemic infections were compared , as were efficacies against streptococcus pneumoniae in a lower respiratory infection . in staphylococcal systemic infections ,\nrwj-416457 was equipotent to twofold more potent than linezolid , with 50% effective dose values ranging from 1.5 to 5  mg / kg of body weight / day .\nrwj-416457 was two- to fourfold less potent than vancomycin against mssa but up to fourfold more potent than vancomycin against ca - mrsa .\nin mssa and ca - mrsa skin infections , rwj-416457 demonstrated an efficacy similar to that of linezolid .\nlocke et al . have reported that tr-700 ( torezolid ) , the active moiety of the novel oxazolidinone phosphate prodrug tr-701 , is highly potent against gram - positive pathogens , including strains resistant to linezolid ( lzd ) .\nhere we investigated the potential of staphylococcus aureus strains atcc 29213 ( methicillin - susceptible s. aureus mssa ) and atcc 33591 ( methicillin - resistant s. aureus mrsa ) to develop resistance to tr-700 .\nthe spontaneous frequencies of mutation of mssa 29213 and mrsa 33591 resulting in reduced susceptibility to tr-700 at 2x the mic were 1.1  10 and 1.9  10 , respectively . these values are ~16-fold lower than the corresponding lzd spontaneous mutation frequencies of both strains . following 30 serial passages in the presence of tr-700 ,\nthe mic for mssa 29213 remained constant ( 0.5  g / ml ) while increasing eightfold ( 0.25 to 2.0  g / ml ) for mrsa 33591 .\nserial passage of mssa 29213 and mrsa 33591 in lzd resulted in 64- and 32-fold increases in lzd resistance ( 2 to 128  g / ml and 1 to 32  g / ml , resp . ) .\ndomain v 23s rrna gene mutations ( escherichia coli numbering ) found in tr-700-selected mutants included t2500a and a novel coupled t2571c\n/ g2576 t mutation , while lzd - selected mutants included g2447 t , t2500a , and g2576 t .\nwe also identified mutations correlating with decreased susceptibility to tr-700 and lzd in the rplc and rpld genes , encoding the 50s ribosomal proteins l3 and l4 , respectively . resistance to linezolid ( lzd ) occurs through mutations in 23s rrna and ribosomal proteins l3 and l4 or through methylation of 23s rrna by cfr . here\nwe report novel l3 mutations , ser145/his146tyr and met169-gly174 , cooccurring with cfr in lzd - resistant staphylococcus aureus isolates recovered from a hospital outbreak in madrid , spain .\nlzd mic values ( 16 , 32 , or 64  g / ml ) correlated with the presence and severity of the l3 mutation .\nall isolates had tr-700 ( torezolid ) mic values of 2  g / ml . the crystal structure of the antibiotic drug candidate rwj-416457 ( figure 30 ) ( systematic name : n-{(5s)-3-[4-(5,6-dihydro-2h,4h-2-methylpyrrolo [ 3,4-c]pyrazol-5-yl)-3-fluorophenyl]-2-oxo-1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}acetamide ) , c18h20fn5o3 , which belongs to the first new class of antibiotics discovered in the past 30 years , has been determined at 150  k .\neach molecule of this drug donates one hydrogen bond to a neighboring molecule and accepts one hydrogen bond to give ( o = c  r  n  ho = c  r  n  h)n linkages along the b - axis direction .\nthe compound contains a pyrrolopyrazole ring , which , owing to its uncommon structure , has been shown to have particular effectiveness against multidrug - resistant bacteria .\nlocke et al . have reported that staphylococcal resistance to linezolid ( lzd ) is mediated through ribosomal mutations ( 23s rrna or ribosomal proteins l3 and l4 ) or through methylation of 23s rrna by the horizontally transferred cfr methyltransferase . to investigate the structural basis for oxazolidinone activity against lzd - resistant ( lzd ) strains , we compared structurally diverse , clinically relevant oxazolidinones , including lzd , radezolid ( rx-1741 ) , tr-700 ( torezolid ) , and a set of tr-700 analogs ( including novel cd - rings and various a - ring c-5 substituents ) , against a panel of laboratory - derived and clinical lzdstaphylococcus aureus strains possessing a variety of resistance mechanisms .\npotency against all strains was correlated with optimization of c- and d - rings , which interact with more highly conserved regions of the peptidyl transferase center binding site .\nactivity against cfr strains was retained with either hydroxymethyl or 1,2,3-triazole c-5 groups but was reduced by 2- to 8-fold in compounds with acetamide substituents .\nthis phase 4 , randomized , double - blind , multicenter trial compared the efficacy and safety of zyvox with vancomycin in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia proven to be caused by mrsa , a serious and difficult - to - treat bacterial infection that is resistant to many antibiotics .\nthe study was designed as a noninferiority study with nested superiority , meaning the primary endpoint would be tested for superiority if it met non - inferiority criteria . in the study , zyvox was noninferior and statistically superior to vancomycin in achieving both clinical and microbiologic success .\nthe primary endpoint was clinical outcome at end of study in the per - protocol population .\nsecondary analyses included clinical outcome at end of treatment in the per - protocol population , clinical outcomes in the modified intent - to - treat population at end of study and end of treatment , microbiologic outcomes at end of study and end of treatment in the per - protocol and modified intent - to - treat populations , and safety and tolerability in the intent - to - treat population .\npatients were randomized to receive zyvox iv 600  mg every 12 hours or vancomycin 15  mg / kg every 12 hours over the course of seven to 14 days ; vancomycin doses could be titrated at the investigator 's discretion based on creatinine clearance and vancomycin trough levels ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " oxazolidinone is a five -

resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) has enabled staging of a cancer in the bile duct confluence according to bismuth 's criteria and is the current preoperative standard to assess phc with an accuracy around 50% .\nmri cholangiography is the golden standard used to delineate the localization and extent of a cancer and the possibility of curative surgery .\nit has a positive predictive value of 86% , but in a recent meta - analysis , bismuth 's criteria had a lower accuracy rate and were of no prognostic value in cases of phc undergoing resection .\nthe decreasing number of individuals subjected to bsc over time mirrored the increased active therapeutic strategy for patients with ihc .\nthe migration of patients to curative and active palliative therapy explains why survival for bsc patients in period c was worse than in period a + b. the improvement in survival over time for patients with icc could be explained by the fourfold increase in number of patients , from 3 to 12 , who had curative surgery ( liver resection and liver transplantation ) from period a to period c contributing in total to 8 patients surviving more than 3 years and 6 to more than five years .\nif these patients subjected to curative surgery are excluded , there is no significant impact on the survival curves over time ( p = 0.10 ) .\nthe three - year survival rate after curative surgery was thus 45% , a figure in agreement with what appears in recent reports .\nan explanation could be that in this study we study the whole cohort of patients not only those referred to the surgical clinic .\nmore patients underwent curative surgery over time but the outcome for ihc patients who had curative surgery did not improve between periods a and b ( n = 10 ) versus period c ( n = 12 ) .\nthe improvement in survival in the last time period was only observed in those surviving longer than one year .\nihc was considered to be a contraindication for liver transplantation during the whole study period . in the 5 cases where liver transplantation was performed diagnosis\na multi - institutional analysis in the nordic countries reported a 5-year survival rate of 58% among those with ihc staged t1n0 and a ca 19 - 9 of less than 100 who underwent liver transplantation .\nbased on this figure it has to be asked if there are more patients with ihc who could benefit from liver transplantation . as a recent meta - analysis shows that elevated ca 19 - 9-levels\nare associated with a worse prognosis independent of treatment , elevated ca 19 - 9-levels will remain a contraindication to transplantation ; even the criteria were expanded . in this material\n, preoperatively discovered lymph node metastases beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament were a contraindication for surgery .\neven if lymph node metastases are a strong predictor of survival , the survival of ihc patients with lymph node involvement can be prolonged with hepatectomy and these cases should not be prematurely deemed noncurative . there was a fourfold increase in number of patients with ihc who were treated with chemotherapy , mainly with gemcitabine .\nthe survival outcome of this therapy did not change over time in this study ; this is consistent with others ' findings [ 17 , 18 ] . among patients selected for tace in the last period of this study the median survival was 18 months . in comparison ,\nthis difference could be explained by a better clinical stage in patients selected for tace . for those with phc\nthere was no improvement in the survival over the three time periods studied ( figure 3 ) .\nthere was no increase in the number treated with curative surgery ( 27% in period a to 30% in period c ) and there was no increase in the number of individuals given active palliative treatment between the first and last periods . despite progress with different treatment options ,\nthat is , liver transplantation   and chemotherapy , the number of patients who benefitted from these treatments was so small that it did not affect the survival rate of the entire population .\nbased on the present findings it seems reasonable to speculate that progress in treatment of phc by surgical methods alone is limited .\nthe mayo protocol with irradiation and chemotherapy and consequent transplantation is reporting a five - year survival of 76% for individuals with phc .\nit also raises the question as to whether downsizing phc and also ihc can increase the number of patients who can benefit from curatively aiming surgery .\nthe role of adjuvant chemotherapy is still debated ; a recent meta - analysis did not show any benefit , while a registry analysis identified that adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significant survival benefits among patients with positive nodes or positive margins .\na more liberal use of chemotherapy during the last four - year period did not transfer into better outcomes .\nthe presently used drug combinations that are considered effective   were not fully adopted even in the last time period ; so there may be survival benefit still to be achieved .\nnew protocols with innovative neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies are needed to further improve long - term outcome following surgery or transplantation for patient with cholangiocarcinoma . in conclusion , this analysis from a well - defined population in sweden who had ihc or phc has found an improvement in survival for patients with ihc .\nmore individuals with ihc were over time treated with curative surgery or chemotherapy . despite improvements in different treatment options , no changes in outcome"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " \n background . \n cholangiocarcinoma is a cancer with a poor prognosis . in this millennium \n there are new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these patients . aim . \n the aim of this study was to find if these changes influenced survival of individuals with proximal cholangiocarcinoma . \n material . \n 627 individuals with a diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma ( not including distal common duct cancer ) during the period from 2000 to 2011 were registered in sweden 's western region . \n the material was divided into three consecutive time periods . \n results . the overall survival curves for individuals with cholangiocarcinoma improved over the three time periods ( n = 627 )  ( p = 0.0013 ) . \n median survival increased from 2.6 months in the first period ( 20002003 ) to 3.6 months in the final four years ( 20082011 ) . \n patients with perihilar cholangiocarcinoma ( phc ) had longer median survival than those with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma ( ihc ) : 6.8 versus 3.2 months ( p = 0.0003 ) . \n an improvement in the survival curves over time was seen for those with ihc ( p = 0.034 ) but not for patients with phc ( p = 0.38 ) . \n nine percent of the patients with ihc had potential curative surgical therapy . \n the three -

up .  \nprogress in synthetic biology is providing the concepts and tools to develop biological engineering as an application of biology , just as chemical engineering is an application of chemistry .  \nalthough the scope of applied synthetic biology is wide , including areas that are  beyond the bioreactor  such as bioremediation , agriculture , and human health , it is apparent that many of the applications of synthetic biology that will materialize in the near future are in metabolic engineering .   in this context , the synthetic biology approach aims to generate scalable , reusable genetic parts for controlling genetically encoded unit operations ( e.g. , enzymes , transporters ) , for the predictable design and construction of metabolic pathways . since its inception , made possible by the advent of recombinant dna technology and the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) ,\nthe goal of metabolic engineering has been to optimize cellular metabolism for a particular process application  often through extensive genetic modification .   while research in metabolic engineering has continued to advance with a growing number of genetic , analytical , and computational tools , the application of synthetic biology to metabolic engineering has the potential to create a paradigm shift .   rather than starting with the full complement of components in a wild - type organism and piecewise modifying and streamlining its function ,\nmetabolic engineering can be attempted from a bottom - up , parts - based approach to design by carefully and rationally specifying the inclusion of each necessary component .   in this way\n, the metabolic engineering process becomes uniform for any goal and eliminates laborious cycles of trial and error . in this review , we discuss synthetic biology as it applies specifically to metabolic engineering applications .  \nfor the purposes of this discussion , we are presenting the typical workflow of synthetic biology within a four step framework ( figure 1 ) .  \nas depicted in the flow diagram , the typical stages involved are : design , modeling , synthesis , and analysis .  \nthe workflow is often highly cyclical , although progress is being made on moving from iterative biological design to more predictable , directed design .   in the following sections\n, we discuss recent progress and current challenges in applying synthetic biology to metabolic engineering for each of the four workflow steps ( design , modeling , synthesis , and analysis ) in general and specifically at the level of genetic parts and metabolic pathways .  \nwhile synthetic biology applies to all levels of biological organization , we are delineating parts ( individual functional units such as promoters , ribosomal binding sites , protein coding sequences , and terminators ) from pathways ( part - based systems ) as there are often different considerations or methodologies employed at these levels .\nimagine an architect preparing blueprints for someone 's dream house .   in the design process , the architect will largely focus on including all of the desired functional and aesthetic components but there will also need to be some consideration given to standard safety and logistical requirements .  \na draft blueprint can be generated to best satisfy the functional and logistical requirements and after the design is approved , the materials needed for construction can be purchased .   in this scenario ,\nthe design and construction ( synthesis ) phases are decoupled due to the availability of standard , readily available building materials .  \nfor example , the construction of metabolic pathways from genetic parts first requires a collection of well - characterized parts , which do not yet exist .  \nthis shortcoming is beginning to be addressed by the synthetic biology community through the development and compilation of standard biological building blocks such as those found in the registry of standard biological parts .  \nalthough virtually nonexistent now , the future availability of modular , functionally interoperable genetic parts that are carefully characterized will allow biological design to focus more exclusively on functional , aesthetic , and logistical concerns independent of construction concerns . in designing individual biological parts , the base - by - base content of that part ( promoter , ribosome - binding site ( rbs ) , protein coding region , terminator , etc .\nrules and guidelines for designing genetic parts at this level are just beginning to be established .  \nin particular , a major consideration in designing protein - coding parts is codon optimization , encoding the same amino acid sequence with an alternative , preferred nucleotide sequence .  \nalthough a particular sequence , when expressed , may be theoretically functional , its expression may be far from optimal or even completely suppressed due to codon usage bias in the heterologous host .  \nalthough the design principles for expressing exogenous genes have not been perfected , existing codon optimization strategies are used routinely to enhance pathway performance .  \ncodon optimization of coding sequences can be achieved using freely available algorithms such as gene designer , stand - alone software made by dna2.0 .  \nin addition to codon optimization , other considerations such as compliance with standard assembly requirements and part - specific objectives including activity or specificity modifications are often considered .  \nfor example , the biobrick methodology requires that biobrick parts exclude four standard restriction enzyme sites , which are reserved for use in assembly .\nextensive collections of parts can be generated by using a naturally occurring part as a template and rationally modifying it to create a library of that particular genetic part .  \nsignificant progress in this area has been recently demonstrated for promoters and rbss [ 12 , 13 ] .   the work by ellis et al .\ndocuments the generation and characterization of two promoter libraries that can be used to tune network behavior a priori by fitting mathematical promoter models with measured parameters .  \nthis model - guided design approach limits system variability , increasing predictability and decreasing the time spent on combinatorial system construction , testing and debugging .  \nnoisy or leaky promoters can complicate system design by adding variability .   in these cases ,\nfiner control over expression can be established by weakening the binding strength of the downstream rbs   or by using two promoter inputs to drive transcription of an output via a modular and gate .\nin addition to increasing the number of parts within existing families ( e.g. , constitutive promoters ) , there is an opportunity to develop entirely new parts families such as those used to build rna devices that can regulate expression posttranscriptionally .  \nwin and smolke developed rna devices that incorporate rna aptamers for sensing small molecules , transmitter sequences that transmit information by way of a conformational change , and actuators such as hammerhead ribozymes that may render the mrna untranslatable depending on the state of the sensor and transmitter .  \nthe benefit of these devices is that they are composed of modular parts and are completely scalable , since rna aptamers can theoretically be designed to sense any small molecule ligand .\nrational pathway design can be thought of as mixing and matching well - known , modular parts and modulating gene expression through various control mechanisms .  \none of the primary motivations behind the attempt to achieve fine control of gene expression in the context of metabolic engineering is simply to balance and optimize flux through a desired pathway .  \nthus , design at the pathway - level is not only concerned with including the necessary parts , but also with controlling the expressed functionality of those parts ( e.g. , a specific gene may be used in different pathways , the level of required expression may differ based upon the context ) .\nparts - based synthetic metabolic pathways will require tunable control , just as their natural counterparts which often employ feedback and feedforward motifs to achieve complex regulation .  \nthe temporal and spatial dynamics necessary for life ( e.g. , diffusion , evolution , growth / death ) make it difficult to achieve this goal .  \nfor example , biological signals must diffuse throughout the cell until it is received by the signal 's receptor , unlike an electrical signal that is insulated and directed along a path .  \ntherefore , information transfer in biological systems is intrinsically noisy , an issue that has been reviewed and continues to be explored [ 21 , 22 ] .  \nthis is the case for gene regulation at the transcription level in which there is a dna - protein interaction between regulatory proteins such as the laci repressor and its operator site , laco .  \nalthough a handful of operator - regulator pairs have been used successfully to construct simple genetic circuits [ 23 , 24 ] , more complex networks will likely require a large repetoire of distinct regulatory elements to eliminate molecular cross - talk .  \ndeveloping regulatory parts such as promoters , operator - regulator pairs , ribosome binding sites ( rbss ) , and riboswitches is a proven way to tackle this problem .  \ntable 1 lists a sampling of regulatory parts for control of various biological processes involved in gene expression .  \nanother approach , based on well - studied natural systems , was recently demonstrated by dueber et al . to complement these methods .\nthis elegant approach uses protein scaffolds that bear modular interaction domains to physically link pathway enzymes that have been tagged with the appropriate corresponding peptide ligands .  \nnot only does enzyme colocalization limit the loss of intermediates to competing pathways , it also enables the direct control of metabolic flux by adjusting the number of interaction domains on the scaffold thereby adjusting the enzyme complex composition .   using a synthetic biology approach , the design of dna sequences encoding metabolic pathways ( e.g. , operons ) should be relatively straightforward .  \nhowever , the prerequisite collection of modular genetic parts has not yet been developed , but progress has been made .  \nsynthetic scaffolds and well - characterized families of regulatory parts have emerged as powerful tools for engineering metabolism by providing rational methodologies for coordinating control of multigene expression as well as decoupling pathway design from construction .  \nthis approach begins to solve the  impedance problem  by providing component variants with covering a range of input / output transfer functions , allowing pathway tenability .  \npathway design should not overlook the fact that exogenous pathways interact with native cellular components and have their own specific energy requirements .  \ntherefore , modifying endogenous gene expression ( e.g. , gene knockouts , knockdowns , overexpression ) may be necessary in addition to balancing cofactor fluxes ( e.g. , atp , nadh ) and installing membrane transporters .  \nfigure 2 illustrates how well - characterized parts can be composited to form functional devices or modules that can then be used to build complex systems , including metabolic pathways .\njust as cars are routinely built from modular components in assembly lines , rapid , modularized construction of microbial chemical factories is on the horizon .  \nenabling this manufacturing process is dna synthesis technology , the chemical fabrication of gene- and even genome - length dna molecules .  \nfor example , putative genes identified computationally in a metagenomics study need not be isolated and cloned ; the sequence information can be outsourced to synthesis companies as bayer et al . recently reported .  \nhowever , protocols exist to synthesize dna in laboratories using common equipment and techniques .  \nfirst of all , the convenience of this approach over traditional cloning allows for the systematic generation of genetic part variants such as promoter libraries ( see section 2 ) .   secondly , it provides a practical way for eliminating restriction sites or undesirable rna secondary structures and to codon optimize genes for the expression in heterologous hosts .  \nthirdly and perhaps most importantly , the generation of biological building blocks will allow for the decoupling of construction from design .\ngenerating genetic parts is as easy as emailing the part 's nucleotide sequence to a dna synthesis company such as dna2.0 , geneart , or genscript .   depending on the length and complexity of the part\nalthough synthesis technology is available for individual laboratories , the time and money required for equipment upkeep may not make investment worthwhile , especially with commercial synthesis prices steadily dropping .  \nstill , the cost of dna synthesis is relatively high and can be a prohibitive factor for some projects .  \nit is anticipated that dna synthesis technology will follow in the footsteps of dna sequencing technology where research and improvements have decreased costs by orders of magnitude .  \nprovide an excellent review of synthesis technologies and strategies , including those that enable in - house synthesis .\nthe ability to make large changes to dna molecules has resulted in standardized methods for assembling basic genetic parts into larger composite devices , which facilitate part - sharing and faster system - level construction .  \nfor example , the registry of standard biological parts supports the use of the biobrick methodology to assemble parts into devices and devices into systems .  \nthe restriction sites flank biobrick parts ( two serve as the prefix and the other two as the suffix ) allowing for restriction - ligation all the while maintaining the same restriction sites .   a standardized assembly method , 3a biobrick assembly , enables a three - way ligation of two insert parts into a plasmid backbone and eliminates the need to gel - purify digested parts and plasmid backbones .   this approach can be automated using programmable liquid - handling robots , providing a scalable assembly process that can be used to quickly build systems from existing genetic components .   in this respect ,\nhigh - throughput pathway assembly is more easily implemented in individual laboratories than de novo dna part synthesis , but there remains the option to outsource this aspect of synthesis through commercial avenues as well .\nother approaches based on type ii restriction enzymes , such as golden gate shuffling , provide ways to assemble many more components together in one step .   a similar one - step assembly approach , circular polymerase extension cloning ( cpec ) , avoids the need for restriction - ligation or single - stranded homologous recombination altogether .  \nthis scalable , sequence - independent cloning technology works by extending overlapping sequences between the part and the plasmid backbone ( e.g. , biobrick prefix and suffix ) , just as polymerase extension occurs in pcr , resulting in a complete circular plasmid .   not only is this useful for cloning single genes , but also for assembling parts into a larger sequences encoding entire metabolic pathways and for generating combinatorial part libraries .   \nmultiplex automated genome engineering ( mage ) was recently introduced as another scalable , combinatorial method for producing large - scale genomic diversity .  \nthis approach makes chromosomal modification easier by simultaneously mutating target sites across the chromosome .   in this method ,\na pool of degenerate oligonucleotides that target specific genomic sites is cyclically introduced into various cells within the population , which generates diversity across the population .  \nmage was used to modify twenty four genetic parts in the dxp pathway , including ribosomal binding sites and enzyme coding sequences for tuning expression levels and knocking out gene function .  \nthis strategy resulted in a fivefold increase in lycopene production in only three days , demonstrating a practical alternative to encoding pathways on plasmids that often require many iterations of testing and optimization .\nplasmid - based expression and chromosomal integration are the two common vehicles for implementing synthetic metabolic pathways and each method has its advantages , described in an excellent review on gene - expression tools .  \nrecently , a new long - term expression method called chemically inducible chromosomal evolution ( ciche ) was presented as an alternative to existing methods .  \nciche avoids complications associated with plasmid replication and segregation , and can be used to integrate multiple copies of genes ( up to 40 copies demonstrated ) into the genome .  \nthese techniques , coupled with in vivo strategies for assembling genetic parts into systems encoding metabolic pathways [ 5052 ] and large - scale ( several hundred kilobases ) in vitro assembly methods , will provide technical platforms for the rapid synthesis of parts and subsequent pathways .   on a larger scale , bacterial genome transplantation and the chemical synthesis of a natural bacterial genome\ncells are not unlike computers in that they process input information to realize output functions .  \na cell 's genome can therefore be thought of as an operating system ( os ) and , similarly , engineered operons encoding metabolic pathways as individual programs that are built from well - characterized , modular parts ( the equivalent of a function in computer science terms ) .  \na twist on this analogy is that there already exists a large pool of parts and pathways in natural and synthetic biological systems and we are collectively learning their biological function through biochemical and bioinformatic analyses .  \ntherefore , before metabolic pathways can be rationally designed and constructed , the genetic parts from which the pathways are built must be carefully characterized . with the capability to synthesize biological parts , it is possible to use molecular - level controls to study and analyze each part .  \none of the major stumbling blocks for the development of well - characertized parts is figuring out exactly what parameters should be measured and how .  \nalthough made from five basic parts , the well - characterized biobrick signaling device bba_f2620 developed by canton et al . provided the first example of what can be measured and a possible standard documentation format  a datasheet ( see canton et al .   for a detailed example of a datasheet ) .  \nthe device 's performance characteristics , including input compatibility , reliability , and transcriptional output demand , are neatly summarized .  \ndatasheets may facilitate rapid widespread adoption of synthetic biological parts , devices , and systems if they include relevant information that is available to the community .\nrecent work toward characterizing promoters demonstrates the utility of measuring the relative strengths of promoters in a library as they are built .  \na separate effort by kelly et al . has proposed a promoter reference standard , a fluoresense - dependent measurement kit and a measurement unit used to report promoter activity as an attempt to normalize absolute measurements taken by various instruments under various conditions .  \nthe conceptual framework developed for promoter measurement could easily be applied to other genetic parts such as rbss and transcriptional terminators .  \nhowever , these tools will only be beneficial if they are supported and adopted by the community .\nalthough well - characterized parts will drastically improve metabolic engineering efforts , there will always be a need for debugging tools and troubleshooting methods .  \nsystems biology provides a framework for analyzing metabolic pathway performance and identifying possible solutions .   integrating high - throughput global measurements\n( i.e. , transcriptomics , proteomics , metabolomics , and fluxomics ) and computational tools ( see section 5 ) offers unprecedented understanding of how engineered pathways affect cell physiology and vice versa across the entire cell .  \nthis kind of analysis can be used to identify bottlenecks in the pathway as well as detrimental side effects that may not have been obvious at the initial design stage .\nused transciptional and metabolite profiling to determine the biochemical interactions of an engineered pathway and the endogenous metabolic network .   in this work , they were not only able to identify the bottleneck that resulted in toxic accumulation of a pathway intermediate , but also the mechanism by which the accumulated metabolite inhibits cellular growth  and a way to overcome the problem .   using a system biology analytical approach , metabolic engineers are able to intelligently modulate synthetic pathway behavior if the measured performance does not meet specifications .  \nfurthermore , the synthetic biology framework should enable the rational forward - engineering of pathways in a more plug - and - play fashion and significantly decrease the time spent on debugging the genetic programs used to encode metabolic function .\nhighly complex electrical circuits are able to be designed with ease because of the existence of computer - aided design ( cad ) software .  \nthis technology is dependent on the high - fidelity virtual representation of physical circuit componentry , which necessitates an accurate mathematical model of each component ( e.g. , transistors , capacitors ) based on a deep understanding of the physics involved .  \nonce the fundamental physics of genetic part behavior is understood , then parts can be designed to be insulated from each other .  \nsubsequently , abstract design based on standard biological models would be possible , allowing cad of intricate metabolic pathways and regulatory networks .   while this is the ideal ,\nthere are a variety of modeling approaches being applied to biology that have various strengths and weaknesses leaving a consolidated , standard modeling approach something to strive for in the future . at the part - level , it is possible to develop highly detailed , quantitative , dynamic models when considering a single or small number of parts .  \nthe software tool promot was developed for modeling parts with ordinary differential equations ( odes ) and enabling interfacing by quantifying the exchange of biological signals ( i.e. , rna polymerases , ribosomes , transcription factors and environmental stimuli ) between parts .   in a similar spirit , sbml- and cellml - based models of genetic parts and well - characterized modules\nhave been proposed for establishing a registry for standard biological models [ 64 , 65 ] .  \nstandard , quantitative models of genetic parts would allow biological engineers to seamlessly integrate the design process with modeling , enabling simulation of engineered systems prior to actual construction ( see design / model loop in figure 1 ) . as the scale of the system to be modeled increases from a single pathway to all pathways within an organism , more attention\nmust be given to selecting a modeling approach as the quality of simulation results can vary simply due to the practical limitations imposed by the increasing number of variables .  \nit is anticipated that as synthetic biology and modeling methods progress , the line between design and modeling will be blurred .  \nthis will condense the workflow into the common design - build - test engineering cycle .  \na variety of cad tools are emerging to make this happen [ 66 , 67 ] .  \nother computational tools are being developed to make novel pathway design a high - throughput process .   from metabolite\nto metabolite ( fmm ) is a web - based tool that constructs a variety of possible enzymatic pathways from an input metabolite to an output metabolite , both of which are provided by the user .  \nthis saves a large amount of time spent searching through the databases for relevant enzymes used in engineered pathways .  \nalthough not automated , the retro - biosynthesis tool ( rebit ) provides access to a searchable database of enzyme - catalyzed reactions categorized by the relevant functional groups of the reactants and products involved in the reaction .  \nrebit returns a list of enzymes capable of consuming or generating any user - defined functional group , which is particularly helpful for designing novel metabolic pathways ( i.e. , nonnatural ) .  \nalthough these tools will facilitate the design of engineered systems , they will also need to take into account connectivity with the existing cellular network .   at this point ,\neven the most well - understood model microorganisms like e. coli and s. cerevisiae are far from being completely modeled [ 70 , 71 ] .  \nhowever , existing metabolic models , when combined with powerful cad tools to develop novel biological systems , will streamline the metabolic engineering process .  \ncurrent genome - scale metabolic models are developed by deriving reaction list from genome annotation , refined using literature information and experimental data , and probed using constraint - based algorithms such as flux balance analysis ( fba ) .  \nthis modeling approach should enable decision - making when it comes to choosing an appropriate microbe to host a particular synthetic pathway and provide a means of predicting the in - context consequences of heterologous expression .\ngenetically programming microbes to perform desired tasks has great potential to transform modern biotechnology .   significant progress has already been made in implementing novel biological functionality in microorganisms , including complex sensing / actuation algorithms and genetic circuits that count [ 7477 ] .  \nfor example , genetic circuits have been engineered to control the transcription of an operon that encodes enzymes and machinery necessary to manufacture and secrete recombinant spider silk monomers in salmonella .  \nas progress is made in synthetic biology to develop well - characterized parts and increasingly complex devices , the design , modeling , synthesis , and analysis of synthetic metabolic pathways will become easier . in metabolic engineering\nchemical plants are built from components that generally fall into one of three classes : unit operations ( e.g. , mixers , reactors , separators ) , connectors ( pipes , tanks ) , and process controllers ( measurement instruments , valves ) .  \nthese component classes exist within cells , but need to be further refined so that they can be used at the level of sophistication found in a chemical plant .  \nin addition to advancing metabolic control through regulation of gene expression ( e.g. , engineered promoters , tunable intergenic regions ) and enzyme colocalization ( modular protein scaffolds , or perhaps synthetic organelles ) , the enzymes themselves ( i.e. , specificity , activity , and allostery ) can be modulated through directed evolution [ 79 , 80 ] or perhaps designed / redesigned computationally .  \nin fact , a recent study showed that swapping catalytic domains from three fungal cellulases can produce chimeras with superior properties .  \nfurthermore , engineered enzymes with novel catalytic properties would enable nonnatural metabolic pathway implementation .  \nhowever , rationally engineering enzymes remain difficult and must be conducted on a case - by - case basis .\ntherefore , it would be advantageous for the metabolic engineering community to work within the synthetic biology framework and focus on generating and populating families of genetic parts that are scalable , measured , and modeled .  \nthe simultaneous construction and characterization of parts will lead to model - based design of pathways in the future , just as complex electrical circuits are built in silico from well - modeled components .  \nhigh - throughput screening technologies have become powerful platforms for quantifying component performance of combinatorially - generated libraries .   likewise , high - throughput measurements provide insight about evolved systems that have adapted to meet performance criteria\n.   these approaches could be very useful in identifying the genetic basis of the biological solution that evolution has provided , a strategy commonly referred to as inverse metabolic engineering .  \nthe interplay of rational , combinatorial , and evolutionary approaches is crucial to the continued elucidation of biological design principles , which allow further forward - engineering of biological systems . in order to achieve the forward - engineering of systems - level metabolism ,\nthe design , modeling , synthesis , and analysis stages must incorporate shared standards in order to efficiently work together .  \nin particular , well - characterized , off - the - shelf genetic components and computational models of these components must be available for use within a standard biological cad tool .   as models of components and modules develop\n, metabolic engineers will be able to move away from using the equivalent of biological machine code ( dna bases : atcgs ) for design to using compiled biological programs ( genes and genetic circuits ) that will enable faster pathway design by reusing pieces of previously optimized pathways .  \nsimilarly , characterization methods and standard measurement units must be agreed on so that parts are characterized as they are made in a way that is useful to the community . as already envisioned by a number of people [ 56 , 61 ] , integration of synthetic biology and systems biology\nwill likely occur as both fields grow , eventually leading to tools that can allow for true cellular - scale network and pathway engineering .   in many respects the fields of synthetic biology and systems biology are perfect complements to each other in regard to outlook and approach as we move toward whole - cell engineering .  \nwhile some overlap already exists between the two fields , synthetic biology currently has significant strengths in the steps of biological design and synthesis whereas systems biology has strengths in analysis and modeling ( figure 1 ) .   to properly integrate the detailed , dynamic , small - network components of synthetic biology with the large - scale analyses and algorithms of systems biology\n, it will be necessary to ensure that work in each field is compatible with work in the other field .  \nfor example , large - scale systems biology models will need to be able to incorporate dynamic behavior demonstrated by constructed synthetic circuits , and synthetic circuits should be constructed and implemented to have minimal cross - talk with existing cellular components .  \none can imagine a time when design can happen at a large - scale level using systems biology algorithms [ 8587 ] followed by molecular - level design using synthetic biology tools , de novo synthesis of components and pathways , analysis of results using high - throughput systems biology methods , and a hybrid large - scale , dynamic model of the entire process .   as the field of synthetic biology matures\n, various branches of synthetic biology that were not discussed here will soon be relevant to implementing novel metabolism in microbes ( figure 3 ) .  \nfor example , a streamlined chassis based on a minimal , refactored genome would simplify host / system interactions and potentially minimize the effect of the metabolic burden the exogenous pathway would place on the cell .  \nlikewise , the concept of designer microbes with engineered genomes could be realized by the developing area of synthetic genomics , which is dependent on the continued improvement in dna synthesis technology .   in the near future ,\nhost strains that have been engineered to confer complex phenotypes ( e.g. , solvent tolerance ) using techniques such global transcription machinery engineering ( gtme ) may provide excellent chassis for synthetic metabolic systems [ 37 , 88 ] .  \neven so , recent successes in synthetic biology - enabled metabolic pathway engineering in common lab strains are very encouraging [ 31 , 8993 ] .  \nfurthermore , work done toward engineering microbial communities may provide an approach to industrial biosynthesis that is superior to monocultures due to increased diversity and flexibility .   \nthe future of this field is extremely exciting and will likely include rapid prototyping , testing , and debugging of synthetic metabolism for the industrial - scale microbial production of a wide variety of natural and novel chemicals and materials ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the generation of well - characterized parts and the formulation of biological design principles in synthetic biology are laying the foundation for more complex and advanced microbial metabolic engineering .   \n improvements in de novo dna synthesis and codon -

producing c cells .\nthe majority of these cancers are well differentiated including papillary thyroid cancers ( ptc ; overall frequency of 86% ) and follicular thyroid cancers ( ftc ; 9% ) , with a much lower frequency of poorly differentiated and undifferentiated ( anaplastic ) thyroid cancers ( < 2% and 1 - 2% , resp . )\nwhile most cases of thyroid cancer of follicular cell origin are sporadic , approximately 3.56.2% have familial origins , whereby an individual 's risk of developing thyroid cancer is > 95% if there are three or more affected family members . whether from a familial origin or sporadic , these types of thyroid cancers are histologically indistinguishable .\nwell - differentiated cancers typically have an excellent prognosis , with cure rates greater than 90% when treated surgically with or without postoperative radioiodine .\nin stark contrast , anaplastic ( undifferentiated ) thyroid cancer ( atc ) is rare , accounting for only 2% of thyroid cancers but represents perhaps the most lethal human malignancy , because it is almost universally fatal . the presentation of atc is often dramatic with a rapidly expanding neck mass leading to airway distress and esophageal obstruction [ 6 , 7 ] .\ndistant metastases at presentation are also extremely common ( 50% ) , contributing to survival times measured in months and sometimes as little as weeks . indeed , the median survival in most studies is approximately 6 months following diagnosis , with only 10% of patients surviving at 1 year [ 69 ] .\nthus , there is an urgent need for better treatment options to improve the dismal outcomes of this aggressive cancer .\nthe american joint committee on cancer has grouped atc into three different stages : stage iva is characterized by intrathyroidal tumors , stage ivb is characterized by a primary tumor exhibiting extrathyroidal extension , and stage ivc is characterized by distant metastases . in the absence of distant metastases , primary surgery may be a management option , particularly if the disease is completely intrathyroidal ( iva ) .\nif a complete resection is possible , followed by adjuvant therapy , a cure may be possible . however , the majority of tumors present in stage ivb with significant extrathyroidal spread , often involving structures considered unresectable , including the great vessels and prevertebral fascia .\natc is typically considered highly radioresistant ; however there are reports of responses to radiation alone , particularly when it is delivered using hyperfractionated techniques [ 7 , 11 ] .\nhowever , even if tumors respond , the effect on long - term survival is minimal .\nradiation appears to have the greatest benefit in the postoperative setting , as patients receiving a total or partial thyroidectomy plus postoperative radiotherapy experienced significantly better survival rates than those only biopsied followed by radiotherapy . while radioactive iodine ( rai ) is a cornerstone of treatment for well - differentiated thyroid cancers that are generally iodine avid , atc is almost universally iodine negative due to its undifferentiated nature .\nunfortunately , control of atc with single agents or with combinations of chemotherapy drugs ( e.g. , doxorubicin , etoposide , cisplatin , bleomycin , and vincristine ) has not been successful , resulting in low response rates and high toxicity .\npatients with undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma given doxorubicin monotherapy exhibited progression of the disease . using a combination of therapy ( e.g. , doxorubicin with cisplatin ) is superior to using a single - agent , with an observed 30% response in a small patient population .\nwhile many studies have reported that chemotherapy alone does not improve survival , chemotherapies have been implicated as beneficial when used in multimodal therapies . in some patients ,\nthe combination of surgery , chemotherapy , and radiotherapy has been shown to locally control the disease in a subset of cases ; however , overall patient survival rates remain extremely poor .\none of the most promising and current anticancer strategies that can be applied to atc is to target  actionable  mutations identified in tumors , particularly activating mutations , gene fusions , and amplifications affecting oncogenes .\nthe potential of targeted drug therapy was exhibited in one particular case study with a 79-year - old male diagnosed with atc .\nsunitinib , a multitargeted inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinase receptors , was administered and the patient exhibited a rapid complete response .\nfurther studies of targeted agents paired with genomic characterization of the tumors may provide additional insights in to which populations of patients benefit the most from each agent .\ncancer is a genetic disease , and the advent of next - generation sequencing ( ngs ) has already transformed cancer care . through large collaborative efforts such as the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) ,\nthe genetic changes underpinning most common cancers have been mapped out . while the majority of genetic changes represent inactivating mutations in tumor suppressor genes and are not actionable or nonconsequential passenger mutations , a subset of activating mutations in oncogenes appears to be druggable and predict response to targeted molecular agents .\nindeed mutation directed therapy is already the standard of care for braf mutant melanoma , egfr mutant lung cancer , and kras mutant colorectal cancer , amongst others [ 1618 ] . while a comprehensive genetic analysis of atc has not been carried out using ngs , the tcga study of ptc is nearing publication .\na current model of thyroid neoplasms suggests that atc arises from preexisting well - differentiated thyroid carcinoma with additional genetic events .\nfound that 76% of those diagnosed with atc had previous or concurrent thyroid disorders with 47% related to well - differentiated thyroid cancers , leading further credence to sequential progression from well - differentiated thyroid cancer to undifferentiated atc .\nunlike many other cancers , the ptc tcga data reveals few mutations in tumor suppressors such as tp53 , but a very high rate of activating mutations in oncogenes .\nthese are mutually exclusive , nonoverlapping mutations and/or fusions that occur in braf ( 62% ) , ras ( hras 4% , nras 8% , and kras 1% ) , alk ( 1% ) , ret ( 6% ) , and ntrk3 ( 2% ) [ 4 , 2123 ] .\nsimilarly , follicular and hrthle cell thyroid carcinomas are dominated by activating mutations in ras ( 4050% ) , pik3ca ( ~10% ) , and pax8/ppar fusions [ 4 , 24 ] . not surprisingly , the above genomic changes observed in well - differentiated thyroid cancers have also been observed in atc , which is discussed further below .\n. mutations of braf occur in 2040% of atc cases ( table 1 ) , with almost all involving a thymine to adenine ( t > a ) transversion at position 1799 , resulting in a nonsynonymous substitution of valine - to - glutamate at the 600th residue ( v600e ) . the v600e braf mutation results in constitutive activity of the braf kinase , which phosphorylates and activates mek and in turn activates erk to produce constitutive mapk pathway stimulation [ 4 , 2527 ] .\nthis signal transduction cascade normally couples signals from cell surface receptors to regulate gene expression , influencing proliferation , differentiation , apoptosis , and survival [ 28 , 29 ] .\nthis mutation has been shown to be associated with aggressive pathological traits , resistance to treatment , and increased recurrence rates .\nmost importantly , activating mutations in braf appear to predict sensitivity to braf inhibitors and this is perhaps the strongest correlation of drug response with a genetic change in cancer care [ 30 , 31 ] . indeed , a dramatic response to braf inhibitors in atc has been reported . a 51-year - old man treated with vemurafenib for braf v600e mutation positive atc had complete resolution of the lung metastatic disease . based on this result\n, it has been suggested that all atc patients should be tested for v600e and that braf inhibitors should be considered in confirmed positive cases and as empirical treatment in rapidly progressive cases pending results of mutation analysis . \n\nh- , k- , and n - ras genes encode for gtpase - proteins at the inner cell membrane responsible for activating the mapk and pi3k / akt / mtor pathways to influence cellular proliferation , differentiation , and survival .\nhowever , when gdp is released and exchanged for guanosine triphosphate ( gtp ) , they become activated and remain active until they hydrolyze gtp to gdp .\npoint mutations that activate ras are commonly observed in many cancers , such as tumors of the head and neck . as for many other cancer types ,\nras mutations associated with thyroid cancers primarily occur in codons 12 , 13 , and 61 .\nthe first two cause increased affinity for gtp , while the third results in inactivation of gtpase function .\nthese mutations in ras genes ( which occur in about 2040% of atc cases ) ( table 1 ) result in a constitutively activated protein , which activates signaling pathways downstream [ 4 , 27 ] .\nthe prevalence of ras mutations in atc suggests that this could play a role in tumor dedifferentiation .\nsmall molecule ras inhibitors have been difficult to utilize due to their inability to outcompete its very high affinity for cytosolic gtp and a lack of suitable binding areas on the protein that will allow disruption of ras effector interactions ; however , investigation into directly targetable upstream and downstream pathway members , such as the mitogen - activated protein kinase , is being studied [ 34 , 35 ] . \n\nctnnb1 encodes -catenin , a key downstream component of the canonical wnt signaling pathway , which regulates cellular processes involved in development , differentiation , and tissue homeostasis [ 32 , 36 ] .\na point mutation in exon 3 of ctnnb1 affects about 560% of atc patients ( table 1 ) .\nthis mutation is prominent in undifferentiated cancers ( e.g. , 025% of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinomas and 66% of undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas ) as opposed to other well - differentiated thyroid cancer types , suggesting that this particular mutation contributes to the progression of poorly or undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas [ 9 , 37 , 38 ] .\nwhen ctnnb1 is mutated , -catenin , which is involved in intracellular signaling , becomes constitutively activated via wnt signaling .\nupregulated -catenin translocates to the nucleus and can activate expression of tumor - promoting genes with concomitant mutations in other genes such as kras and tp53 [ 39 , 40 ] .\nfor this reason , efforts are being made to target and inhibit the aberrant wnt/-catenin signaling pathway .\nthe use of regular nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) has been shown to reduce incidence of various types of human cancers .\nthe antitumor actions exhibited by nsaids have been shown to be mediated partly through suppression of this wnt pathway , resulting in the induction of -catenin degradation .\nother potential therapeutics include small molecule inhibitors , such as lithium chloride which can modulate the wnt signaling cascade , wnt - blocking antibodies which have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in a variety of cancer types , and wnt - modulatory peptides which have been shown to decrease tumor growth and disrupt wnt signaling . \n\npik3ca encodes the p110 catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase , which functions to activate the pi3k / akt / mtor pathway to regulate cell cycle progression , adhesion , and motility .\nbecause of its ability to activate oncogenic activity , pik3ca is of major interest for targeted drug therapy , as multiple alpha - specific oral pik3ca inhibitors are available and are demonstrating responses in clinical trials .\nin addition to the above , the oncogene akt1 is overexpressed and plays a key role in thyroid tumorigenesis [ 42 , 43 ] .\nwhile akt activation promotes resistance to radiation therapy and standard chemotherapy , targeted therapeutics such as small - molecule inhibitors of the akt serine / threonine kinases have the potential to inhibit akt signals and can potentially induce apoptosis and decrease tumor cell growth in those cells which require the elevation in akt signaling [ 44 , 45 ] .\nmutations in braf and ras are commonly found in well - differentiated thyroid cancers , but they are also found in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid cancer types , so it would be reasonable to suggest that these mutations represent an early event in the progression of thyroid cancers .\nit remains to be determined at which stage of thyroid cancer development activation of the other oncogenes discussed above occurs .\nmutations in the tumor suppressor tp53 are commonly associated with 5080% of atc cases ( table 1 ) .\nthis gene , which encodes the cell cycle regulator p53 , results in loss of this tumor suppressor expression and leads to impairment of the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis [ 4 , 8 ] .\nthere is great interest in targeting tp53 because of the high frequency of tp53 mutations in cancer ; however no successful pharmacologic strategies to replace lost tumor suppressor function have been successful to date . \n\npten is a tumor suppressor gene and its mutated form is associated with 515% of atc cases ( table 1 ) . through epigenetic effects ,\nmethylation of pten has been implicated in the progression of benign thyroid adenoma to aggressive atc .\npten methylation is associated with decreased , or complete lack of , pten expression and has also been found to stimulate other genetic alterations associated with the pi3k / akt / mtor pathway axis , including both ras and pik3ca . while restoring pten\ntumor suppressing activity is much more difficult , pten loss is potentially druggable through targeting the downstream deregulated pi3k pathway with pi3k inhibitors .\nstructural alterations ( e.g. , copy number variation , translocations , and fusions ) in addition to single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) mutations can be determined by whole genome sequencing ( wgs ) in order to attempt to understand why some cancers such as atc are more aggressive and less responsive to treatments than others .\none explanation has proposed that chromosomal rearrangements , often identified more frequently in cancers that are more aggressive , may provide the answer . in particular ,\nanaplastic lymphoma kinase ( alk ) gene fusions have been associated with aggressive thyroid cancers , whereby rearrangements with alk result in tumorigenic activity .\none of the alk rearrangements described involves the striatin ( strn ) gene observed more commonly in thyroid cancers .\nthis strn - alk fusion results in constitutive activity of alk kinase and induction of thyroid cell proliferation and tumorigenesis .\nin addition to strn - alk gene fusions , the echinoderm microtubule - associated protein - like 4 ( eml4 ) gene has been reported as another gene fusion with alk .\nthis fusion is more commonly described in lung cancer and results in constitutive alk activation leading to cell proliferation and tumorigenesis .\neml4-alk has also been found to be a potent oncogenic activator in cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models .\ntreatment with crizotinib , a small molecule alk inhibitor , has demonstrated significant responses and improved disease - free survival in other cancers .\nadditionally , in vitro studies in atc cells harboring alk fusions have demonstrated a 65% reduction in atc proliferation compared to 20% for standard chemotherapy [ 47 , 48 ] .\nin addition to the fusions described above , rearrangement of the peroxisome proliferator - activated receptors ( ppar ) with the pax8 gene , associated with radiation induced thyroid cancers , expresses a fusion protein ( pax8/ppar ) .\nthis fusion has been found to accelerate cell growth , inhibiting normal tumor suppression by ppar and therefore acts as an oncogene .\nppar agonists such as troglitazone , rosiglitazone , and pioglitazone have been tested in vitro and exhibited growth inhibitions as well as apoptosis of tumor cells .\nwhile results from various studies regarding ppar agonists are promising , they still require more trials with larger groups and longer followups to be conclusive .\nother rearrangements common to thyroid cancers include ret / ptc1 and ret / ptc3 , which both result from intrachromosomal paracentric inversions and have a strong correlation with radiation exposure [ 4 , 52 ] .\nthe ret tyrosine kinase becomes activated by this rearrangement , leading to constitutively activated mapk signaling and tumorigenesis in thyroid cells .\nsunitinib , a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor , acts as an inhibitor of ret and exhibits some efficacy in these tumor types .\nchromosomal rearrangements involving neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinases ( ntrks ) can also occur in thyroid carcinomas and are known as trk rearrangements .\nntrk1 and ntrk3 fusions have been reported in multiple cancers including glioblastoma , lung cancer , and in 1 - 2% of ptc [ 21 , 54 , 55 ] and have a strong correlation with exposure to radiation [ 4 , 56 ] .\nthese fusions can involve multiple different partners leading to constitutive kinase activation [ 54 , 55 , 57 ] .\nmost importantly , small - molecule inhibitors of trk are available and selectively inhibit the proliferation and colony formation of cell lines harboring trk fusions but had no effect on wild type lines .\nwhile trk fusions have not yet been reported in atc , it is likely that future ngs studies will reveal these genomic alterations similar to other mutations that are shared with well - differentiated cancers . given the responses observed with other patients with atc harboring other fusions , trk inhibitors will likely be of clinical benefit to patients harboring ntrk fusions .\nmicrornas ( mirnas ) are small , single - stranded , noncoding rnas , which are able to bind to gene targets and repress posttranscriptional gene expression .\nthey may act as oncogenes and/or tumor suppressors in the same cell , whereby inducing effects on cell differentiation , proliferation , and apoptosis leading to tumorigenesis [ 58 , 59 ] .\nthe specific mirna expression profiles have been shown to significantly differ amongst medullary thyroid cancers when compared to cancers derived from follicular cells ; however , amongst those derived from follicular cells , there are variable mirna expression profiles .\nprevious studies have shown that there is significantly reduced expression of mir-26a , mir-30a-5p , mir-30d , and mir-125b in atc .\noverexpression of mir-26a and mir-125b in two atc human - derived cell lines resulted in cell growth inhibition , suggesting that these mirnas are involved in cell cycle regulation .\nadditionally , a group of seven mirnas known as mir-17 - 92 ( mir-17 - 3p , mir-17 - 5p , mir-18a , mir-19a , mir-19b , mir-20a , and mir-92 - 1 ) have been shown to be upregulated in atc cell lines and lesions .\nwhile mirnas are not directly druggable , their presence in the bloodstream or the tumor tissue has been useful for early detection or prognostic biomarkers .\nthey may be highly useful in both manners to improve the care of patients with atc .\ngene methylation of promoter regions leading to interrupted transcription is commonly implicated in thyroid cancers .\nmethylation of the promoter region of the pten gene leading to its silencing is commonly associated with atc .\npten methylation is frequently associated with the genetic alterations in the pi3k - akt pathway in thyroid tumors , including mutations of ras and pik3ca mutation and amplification .\nlack of pten regulation in this setting creates a self - amplifying loop of pi3k - akt pathway activation , reinforcing the importance of this axis in driving thyroid oncogenesis .\natc , a devastating cancer resulting from genomic instability and a multitude of mutations , is universally fatal with no effective therapies .\nsurvival rates have changed little over the past 30 years , which suggests that traditional methods of surgery , radiation , and chemotherapy are inadequate .\ncomprehensive genetic characterization of atc tumors has the potential to identify effective novel agents , as well as biomarkers of drug sensitivity and resistance .\nnew individualized therapeutics , based on genomic analysis of individual tumors , may hold the promise of effective treatment .\nthese findings will likely have broader implications due to significant genetic overlap with well - differentiated thyroid cancer .\ngenomically derived treatment as part of a multidisciplinary approach may hold the promise of successful treatment for patients diagnosed with atc ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " thyroid cancer is an endocrine malignancy with an incidence rate that has been increasing steadily over the past 30 years . \n while well -

antigens or modified self - molecules have been identified as target of humoral and cellular immune responses in patients with atherosclerotic disease thus behaving as dangerous signals able to activate proinflammatory responses .\noxidative stress , increasingly reported in these patients , is the major event causing structural modification of proteins .  \noxidized low density lipoproteins ( ldl ) are the best characterized autoantigen . in particular , it has been demonstrated that about 10% of t lymphocytes infiltrating human atherosclerotic plaques are specific for oxidized ldl .\nin addition to ldl , other self - molecules modified by oxidative stress become target of autoimmune reaction in atherosclerosis [ 1214 ] .\nanother two categories of autoantigens that have been implicated in atherosclerosis are the stress - induced heat shock proteins and antigens expressed by dying cells [ 15 , 16 ] .\ncell death in the atherosclerotic plaque may occur by apoptosis or by necrosis [ 17 , 18 ] .\nthe uptake of apoptotic cells by macrophages and some subsets of dendritic cells may induce an anti - inflammatory response and play an important role in maintaining peripheral immune tolerance [ 19 , 20 ] .\nconversely , the uptake of necrotic cells or even a delayed uptake of apoptotic cells may result in immune activation and risk for the development of autoimmunity .   in a previous study , by the use of a molecular cloning strategy to identify endothelial autoantigens , we provided evidence of serum anti - actin antibodies in patients with carotid atherosclerosis and we suggested that actin is an autoantigenic molecule of potential clinical interest in carotid atherosclerosis .\nwe designed this study to confirm and extend our previous results on the possible role of actin as target antigen of immune reactions in carotid atherosclerosis . for this purpose\n, we evaluated the proliferative response of circulating t lymphocytes obtained from patients and healthy subjects , stimulated in vitro with actin .  \nwe also investigated the ability of actin - specific circulating t lymphocytes to produce the pro - inflammatory cytokines ifn- and tnf- and the anti - inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 .\nwe enrolled 17 consecutive patients with asymptomatic severe or preocclusive carotid - artery stenosis 70% or with symptomatic stenosis undergoing endarterectomy ( cea ) at the sapienza university of rome .\npatients were grouped according to the histological type of their atherosclerotic plaques following the classification of stary et al . .\nthirteen patients had type v plaques and 4 patients had type vi plaques . in brief ,\ntype v plaques are defined as lesions in which prominent new fibrous connective tissue has formed .\ntype vi plaques are defined as lesions in which disruption of the lesion surface , hematoma , or hemorrhage and thrombotic deposits have developed and may be referred to as complicated lesions .\nexclusion criteria for patients were recent infections ( < 1 month ) , autoimmune diseases , malignancies , and inflammatory diseases before enrollment . the inclusion criteria for healthy subjects were no history of myocardial infarction , coronary bypass , coronary angiography with angioplasty or stenting or both , cerebrovascular accident , or peripheral vascular disease\nall hematological variables including risk factors for atherosclerosis were in the range of  normal  values\nvenous peripheral blood was drawn in heparin tubes from the 17 patients ( before surgery ) and from the 16 healthy subjects . peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmc )\nwere separated from plasma by density gradient centrifugation ( lympholyte , cedarlane , on , canada ) and were used in the proliferation assay .\ntriplicate cultures of pbmc ( 1  10  cells / ml ) were stimulated for 7 days with rabbit muscle actin ( sigma - aldrich , milan , italy , 20  g / ml ) , phytohemagglutinin ( pha , burroughs wellcome co. , beckenham , uk , 2  g / ml ) as a positive control of the assay , or human serum albumin ( hsa , sigma - aldrich , 10  g / ml ) as a negative control , or left unstimulated .\nendotoxin contamination in actin , as determined by the quantitative chromogenic limulus amebocyte lysate assay ( qcl-1000 , biowhittaker , walkersville , md ) , was < 0.03 endotoxin units/g of protein . to neutralize a possible endotoxin effect ,\nall cells were cultured in the presence of polymyxin b ( 10  g / ml , sigma - aldrich ) .\ncell proliferation was assessed by h - methyl - thymidine incorporation assay as previously described .\nthe proliferative response was expressed as stimulation indices ( si , ratio between the mean cpm in stimulated cultures and that in unstimulated cultures ) . the mean stimulation index in healthy subjects + 3 standard deviations was taken as the threshold level for positivity .\nifn- , tnf- , il-4 , and il-10 concentrations in culture supernatants of circulating t lymphocytes were quantified with commercially available enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) sets ( opteia set , bd biosciences , ca , usa ) as recommended by the manufacturer .\nthe limits of detection were 1  pg / ml for ifn- , 2  pg / ml for tnf- , il-4 , and il-10 .\nmann - whitney u and wilcoxon nonparametric tests were used to investigate the significance of unpaired and paired data .\nall the covariates were examined in univariate analyses as predictors for actin - specific cellular response .\nfisher 's exact test and mann - whitney u test were used to evaluate the differences in discrete and continuous clinical characteristics between patients ' groups .\nin our selected healthy subject population , we determined a mean si value of 1.13 and a sd of 0.29 and we calculated the value of 2.0 as the cutoff level for positivity .\nactin induced a proliferative response in 8 of 17 ( 47% ) patients ' pbmc samples , with si ranging from 2.6 to 21.1 ( figure 1 ) .\nthe difference between the si mean values in patients and healthy subjects was statistically significant ( 4.4 versus 1.1 , p = 0.02 by mann - whitney u test ) .\nunivariate analysis showed that the presence of diabetes in patients was significantly associated with proliferative response to actin ( p = 0.04 , figure 2 ) .\npbmc samples from patients produced higher concentrations of ifn- and tnf- than pbmc from healthy subjects ( figure 3 ) . in patients , ifn- and tnf- concentrations were higher in pbmc samples that proliferated in response to actin than in nonproliferating ones ( figure 3 ) .\nwe found the presence of a positive correlation between ifn- concentrations and si ( p < 10 ; r = 0.71 ) ( figure 4 ) .\nin this study , we demonstrated for the first time a role of actin as a target autoantigen of cellular immune reactions in patients with carotid atherosclerosis .\nas observed for other candidate autoantigens , actin induced a proinflammatory th1 activation , characterized by high ifn- and tnf- expression .\nth1 response , not counteracted by an increase of anti - inflammatory il-4 and il-10 production , may contribute to tissue damage , endothelial dysfunction , and systemic inflammation .\nfurther characterization of these will establish whether they are a regulatory population able to counteract .\nour results support previous findings indicating that inflammatory autoimmune reactions are not exclusively localized within atherosclerotic lesions but can also contribute to systemic inflammation in patients with atherosclerosis [ 1214 ] .\ndistinct cytokines promote pro- as well as antiatherogenic processes , thus modulating plaque development and clinical outcome [ 14 , 25 , 26 ] .\nifn- and tnf- mediate proatherogenic processes by promoting monocyte activation and by influencing collagen synthesis and expression of adhesion molecules , tissue factor , and matrix metalloproteinases [ 27 , 28 ] .\nour finding on actin - specific t - cell activation is in line with a previous study where we identified actin as a candidate autoantigen of humoral immune response in patients with carotid atherosclerosis .\nit can polymerize in the presence of atp and its structure is remarkably conserved during evolution .\nanti - actin antibodies have been associated with various autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus , a disease in which endothelial damage plays a key role .\nanti - filamentous actin antibodies characterize autoimmune hepatitis type 1 where the binding domain of -actinin on actin was shown to be a predominant actin epitope .\nanti - actin antibodies were also found in 5285% of patients with autoimmune hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis , in 22% of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis , and in patients with celiac disease and with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia [ 3134 ] .\nfurthermore , nonmuscle -actinin 4 and cytoplasmic -actin were identified as immunodominant ovarian autoantigens involved in ovarian autoimmunity .\nan interesting and extremely important aspect in autoimmune diseases is to understand how abundant and highly conserved self - proteins can become the antigenic target of autoimmune reactions .\nit has been shown that apoptotic cancer cells may render actin immunogenic by exposing it on their surfaces [ 36 , 37 ] .\nin addition , many autoantigens , and in particular actin , represent a substrate for the proapoptotic cysteine proteases .\nthe polypeptides produced in this way can be released into the extracellular space or can be presented as neoantigens , thus generating an autoimmune response [ 38 , 39 ] .\ninterestingly , several studies have shown the presence of apoptotic cells , particularly macrophages and smooth muscle cells , in all stages of atherosclerosis development [ 40 , 41 ] .   in our study\n, we observed a positive association between the presence of diabetes and the response to actin .\npancreatic beta - cell death by apoptosis , which can be induced by multiple stresses , contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes .\nthe possibility that diabetes , characterized by increasing oxidative stress and apoptosis , may trigger the autoimmune response to actin is interesting and needs further investigation .  \na limitation of our study is that it does not provide a causal association between the t - cell response to actin and atherosclerosis in humans . in vivo experimental models\nour study takes research into the involvement of autoimmune responses in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis , a small step ahead indicating actin as a candidate autoantigen target of cell - mediated immune responses in a proportion of patients with carotid atherosclerosis .\nour findings here call for further studies to identify epitopes on actin recognized by specific t lymphocytes ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall associated with autoimmune reactions . in a previous study \n , we observed the presence of actin -

nar ( dromedary female    bactrian male ) and kez - nar ( bactrian female    dromedary male ) followed by f1 backcrossing with either dromedary for increased milk productivity or bactrian camel for wool and cold resistance ( faye and konuspayeva 2012 ) .\nf2 hybrids ( f1    f1 ) in old world camels are usually not favoured because of a difficult character and weak progeny performance ( faye and konuspayeva 2012 ) . in western regions of turkey ,\na relished sport is camel wrestling , where prized male tulus compete against each other in heavily regulated fights ( vedat 2010 ) . in this study\n, we developed diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) to identify f1 hybrids between dromedary and bactrian camels and their backcrosses .\nthese markers will facilitate the validation of non - invasive or historic samples with unclear or otherwise cryptic ancestry . as part of an on - going research project\n, we sequenced the genomes of 25 old world camelids [ c. dromedarius ( n  =  9 ) , c. ferus ( n  =  9 ) , c. bactrianus ( n  =  7 ) ] and aligned them to the c. ferus cb1 genome assembly ( genbank i d : gca_000311805.2 ) . to verify their species identity\n, these source individuals had previously been genotyped at 18 nuclear microsatellite loci and sanger sequenced for 800  bp of mitochondrial dna ( unpublished data ) .\n( 2013 ) and selected polymorphisms that were fixed for different alleles between c. dromedarius and both bactrian camel species , c. bactrianus and c. ferus ( see  supplementary methods in online resource 1 ) .\nwe tested the 26 candidate loci using pcr and sanger sequencing ( see  supplementary methods in online resource 1 ) on a panel of control individuals including three bactrian camels , three dromedaries , two hybrids ( f1 and f1 backcross ) and a two - humped individual with uncertain genetic background .\nall 26 candidate loci produced pcr products of the expected sizes , but we selected for sequencing only those 12 loci which produced single strong bands over consistent conditions ( table  1 ) . upon sequencing , all 12 loci were diagnostic between dromedaries and bactrian camels ( table  2 ) .\nhowever , in the f1 hybrid ( hyb56 ) only 10 ( 83.3  % ) of the diagnostic loci were heterozygous and the remaining two loci were homozygous for the bactrian allele ( table  2 ) .\nthis suggests that at these two loci ( hp264 and hp288 ) the bactrian allele may be present at low frequency in dromedaries as a result of being a shared ancestral polymorphism ( not diagnostic ) or from historical hybridization between the two species .\nthe f1 backcross ( hyb55 ) was heterozygous for two ( 16.7  % ) of the diagnostic loci and homozygous for the bactrian allele in the remaining loci .\nin the two -

secreting tumors are confined to structures derived from the foregut ( that is , the parotid , submandibular and sublingual glands and the mucus glands throughout the upper respiratory tract ) .\nthese glands are also associated with the larynx ( supraglottis and subglottis ) , nasopharynx and oropharynx ( tonsil and posterior tongue ) .\nthe tumor extends well beyond the visible and palpable limits of the salivary gland region .\nthis infiltrative capacity is the hallmark of this carcinoma because of which multiple local recurrences are common despite aggressive surgical and irradiation therapy .\nthe proliferating cell is a small cuboidal cell with a round hyperchromatic nucleus and scant cytoplasm .\nthis is of clinical significance since predominantly solid acc are found to be more aggressive and are associated with a worse prognosis than predominantly tubular or cribriform acc .\nacc occasionally invades regional lymph nodes by direct extension , but true embolic lymph node metastasis is rare .\nhowever , distant metastasis to organs other than lymph nodes is common , particularly late in the course of the disease , the lungs being the primary site followed by bones , the liver and the brain .\nit is a malignancy that reinforces the point that tumor growth rate and metastatic capability are independent tumor properties .\nclinical features depend on the site involved and the nerve affected . in nasopharyngeal localization ,\nthe symptoms most commonly found are epistaxis , progressive nasal stenosis , dysfunction of the eustachian tube and in relation to the invasion of the skull base , disorders of ocular motility , diplopia , facial pain , dysfunction of ix , x , xi and xii pairs of cranial nerves and more rarely , horner 's syndrome . wherever it arises\n, acc presents as a painful or a painless solid tumor mass with or without ulceration , cranial nerve palsy or paresis .\nthis case highlights the fact that acc may rarely have clinical and radiological features similar to that of a cyst .\na 50-year - old female reported to the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery with the chief complaint of progressive dysphagia due to a swelling in relation to right oropharyngeal region .\npatient 's past medical history was unremarkable and personal history was negative for tobacco consumption .\nintraoral examination revealed a 4  4 cm swelling in relation to right oropharynx extending superiorly from soft palate inferiorly up to palatine tonsil medially till midline displacing uvula to the left side [ figure 1 ] .\nswelling was well -

growing mass with a propensity to invade peripheral nerves with a high recurrence rate and metastases to other organs .\npain is usually a common and important associated symptom , occasionally occurring before clinical evidence of the disease .\nneoplastic cell neurotropism causes pain , which was not evident in our case , suggesting no invasion of tumor cells into adjacent peripheral nerves .\nthe fine - needle aspiration biopsy of acc characteristically shows small clusters or groups of basaloid tumor cells encircling the hyaline globule .\ncribriform  pattern where nests of tumor cells have a sieve - like or  swiss cheese  configuration .\npattern where the tumor nests and islands are completely filled with basaloid tumor cells without cystic spaces .\nthe cystic spaces may contain basophilic mucinous material or eosinophilic material . usually , the tumor islands are ultrastructurally surrounded by fibrous stroma or hyalinized stroma , which is replicated basal lamina . in most acc ,\nall three patterns can usually be observed , although the distribution varies greatly between different lesions .\ntumor is graded according to szanto et al.cribriform or tubular ( grade i ) , less than 30% solid ( grade ii ) , or greater than 30% solid ( grade iii ) .\nacc with high - grade transformation refers to the presence of a pleomorphic mitotically active high - grade carcinoma component arising in an otherwise conventional acc of any pattern / grade .\nthe transformed component is typically of a purely ductal phenotype with a solid or cribriform appearance . unlike conventional acc , which is characterized by small , hyperchromatic , monomorphic nuclei and scant cytoplasm ,\nimmunohistochemistry reveals that the luminal tumor cells are diffusely positive for cytokeratin , epithelial membrane antigen , carcino embryonic antigen and cd117 ( c - kit ) indicating ductal origin and those that surround the pseudo cysts show positivity for s-100 , smooth muscle actin , calponin and variable positivity for cytokeratin suggestive of myoepithelial cell differentiation . over expression of p53 and\nthere is also strong reactivity for basement membrane components such as type iv collagen , laminin and heparan sulphate ( perlecan ) .\naffinity of tumor cells to proliferate along the basement membranes is responsible for frequent invasion of tumor cells into basement membrane - rich tissues such as peripheral nerves , blood vessels and skeletal muscles .\ncytogenetically , the most consistent , although not exclusive , reported alterations have been at chromosomes 6q , 9p and 17p12 - 13 regions .\nthe differential diagnosis of acc includes tumors that also exhibit tubular and cribriform structures such as polymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma ; tumors with basaloid cellular morphology such as basal cell adenoma and basal cell adenocarcinoma ; and tumors with a dual population of ductal and myoepithelial cells such as pleomorphic adenoma .\npolymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma occurs almost exclusively in the minor salivary glands and may contain overlapping histopathologic features with acc such as ductal , tubular and even cribriform growth .\nhowever , the presence of cuboidal or columnar cells containing pale and ovoid nuclei with eosinophilic cytoplasm is in contrast with the hyperchromatic and angulated cells of acc .\nin addition , polymorphous low - grade adenocarcinoma shows low expression of c - kit compared with the high c - kit expression of acc .\npleomorphic adenoma can be identified by the presence of mesenchymal , especially cartilaginous differentiation in the stroma .\npleomorphic adenoma expresses glial fibrillary acidic protein and cd57 , but accs do not react with these markers .\nbasal cell adenoma can be identified by the presence of a capsule and lack of stromal and perineural invasion .\nbasal cell adenocarcinoma may be more difficult to differentiate with solid acc ; however , lack of clear cytoplasm and hyperchromatic , angulated nuclei with the presence of peripheral palisaded nuclei in the former may aid in diagnosis .\nalso , most tumors displaying a solid component of acc will often display areas of cribriform or tubular growth .\nspiro et al . found the following factors to be important in prognosis : site , size and extension into adjacent structures .\nperineural invasion and bone destruction was not present in our case , favoring good prognosis .\nthe underlying principle in the treatment of acc is that tumor cells extend well beyond the clinical or radiographic margins and this tumor undergoes not only perineural invasion but also perineural spread .\ntherefore , it generally requires excision with the widest margins possible and postoperative radiation therapy of 6000 - 7500 cgy . the best treatment considered for acc is unanimously radical surgical resection followed by radiotherapy .\nhowever , in cases of nasopharyngeal extension , the frequent perineural and perivascular infiltrations association with the anatomical structures of the nasopharynx make the surgical approach risky on account of technical difficulties , substantially due to the proximity of surgical margins to critical neural and vascular structures .\nsurgical treatment , therefore , is often characterized by incomplete excision , consequently leading to increased frequency of local recurrence .\nthe 5-year survival rate is 75% but 10-year survival rate is only 20% and survival rate at 15 years is about 10% .\noverall prognosis relates to several factors histologically solid patterns bode worse than cribriform pattern . in our case , lesion was cribriform type , which has better prognosis .\nclinical size > 4 cm is indicative of more subclinical spread and is associated with a worse prognosis . delayed diagnosis and treatment\nsurgical margins that are not clear or close , despite postoperative radiation therapy are also associated with a poor prognosis , which is the single most important factor associated with local recurrence .\nclinical and ct findings were suggestive of a benign cystic mass and diagnosis of acc was not realized until pathologic sections were studied . in view of histopathologic findings , postoperative irradiation was selected as supplemental treatment .\nthe present case highlights the need to be aware of unusual presentation of acc as soft , fluctuant cystic mass ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the adenoid cystic carcinoma is a relatively rare epithelial tumor of the major and minor salivary glands , accounting for about 1% of all malignant tumor of the oral and maxillofacial regions . \n peak incidence occurs between the 5th and 6th decades of life . \n the clinical and pathological findings typical of this tumor include slow growth , peri -

funded population - based national hpv vaccination program ( nhvp ) commenced in australia in 2007 .\nthis program aimed to deliver a course of three vaccinations of the quadrivalent hpv vaccine gardasil to girls aged 12 to 13 years , with a two - year  catch - up program  for 13- to 18-year - old girls through schools and a two - year  catch - up program  for women aged 18 to 26 years through general practices and community - based programs .\nthe vaccination coverage for school - aged girls is now 70% . in early 2009 , two years after the nhvp had commenced , the royal australian and new zealand college of obstetricians and gynaecologists set up a quality improvement program in colposcopy ( c - quip ) with the aim of improving care for women with screen - detected abnormalities .\none of the key drivers of the c - quip program is that the number of women who are treated with a low - grade eventual diagnosis on pathology is minimised .\nthis audit standard was chosen due to concern regarding the use of excisional treatment in young women with a good prognosis .\nwe set out to examine the trends in excisional treatment in australia over the last decade and whether the nhvp or c - quip program had been associated with alterations in the incidence of cervical excisional treatment in young women .\ndata were obtained from four mandated national data collections to develop a single dataset for this study . to provide a population denominator , census - derived point estimates of the age - specific female population in australia for the period 2004 to 2013 were obtained from the australian bureau of statistics ( abs ) .\ndata regarding the number of histological diagnoses of cervical dysplasia were obtained from the australian institute of health and welfare ( aihw ) . the aihw dataset reports statistics from the cervical screening registers of each state and territory , compiled into the national dataset by the aihw for purposes of national monitoring and audit .\naustralia has no overarching dataset regarding all procedures in both inpatient and outpatient ( office ) settings . to capture the most complete dataset possible\nthe first source was the aihw national procedural dataset , collected under the auspice of the australian health ministers ' advisory council ( ahmac ) through the national health information agreement .\nthese data are collected as specified in the national minimum data sets relating to hospitals and day procedure facilities , pooling data supplied by state and territory health authorities .\nit is important to recognize that these data provide information only about procedures performed on admitted patients in hospitals and day surgery facilities .\n morbidity ( kappa 0.86 ) . to cover excisional procedures performed in nonadmitted patients ,\nour other source of procedural information was medicare data from the australian national medical benefits scheme ( mbs ) billing dataset .\nthe mbs billing data report procedural services that are performed by a registered provider for services that qualify for medicare benefit and for which a claim has been processed by medicare australia .\nthus , these are complimentary data to the aihw , capturing both inpatient procedures and outpatient ( rooms ) procedures billed through medicare\n. the mbs dataset does not include services provided by hospital doctors to public patients in public hospitals ( procedures captured in the aihw dataset ) or services that qualify for a benefit under the department of veterans ' affairs ( dva ) national treatment account . the aihw and mbs datasets are complementary and obviously not mutually exclusive , so we separately analysed each dataset .\nanalysis of variance was undertaken using regression with calculation of r and adjusted r ( ar ) values , and comparisons were made using 2  2 tables to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals , with chi - square to calculate p - values .\nthis study received approval from the australian national university human research ethics committee ( protocol 2015/347 ) .\nnational data regarding the incidence of low - grade ( hpv effect + cin1 ) , high - grade ( cin2 + cin3 ) , and endocervical dysplasia ( adenocarcinoma in situ ) for the period from 2004 to 2013 inclusive were used with the abs population estimates to calculate age - stratified incidence rates ( number of histologically confirmed cases per 1000 women ) between the prevaccination epoch ( 20042007 ) and the postvaccination epoch ( 20082013 ) .\nthe incidence of low - grade change fell across all three age - bands ( figure 1 ) : 20 to 24 years ( p < 0.005 ) ; 25 to 34 years ( p < 0.005 ) ; and 35 years or older ( p < 0.005 ) .\nthe incidence of high - grade change fell in the 20-to-24-year group ( p < 0.005 ) but rose slightly for the older age groups ( figure 2 ) : 25 to 34 years ( p < 0.005 ) and 35 years and older ( p < 0.005 ) .\nthe incidence of glandular dysplasia was unchanged for the age group 20 to 24 years ( p = 0.09 ) , increased for the age group 25 to 34 years ( p < 0.005 ) , and remained unchanged for the age group 35 years or older ( p = 0.15 ) ( figure 3 ) .\nthe mbs billing dataset was the smaller of the two , recording 82521 excisional treatments during the ten - year study period .\nthe aihw procedural dataset contained 153421 excisional procedures over the same period , 86% more than the mbs .\nage - stratified incidence rates for all excisional treatments ( loop excision + cone biopsy ) were calculated separately for the mbs and aihw datasets . in the mbs\ndataset the incidence rate of excisional treatment fell significantly in all age groups across the study period ( figure 4 ) .\nthe aihw dataset showed significant reductions for the age groups 20 to 24 years ( p < 0.005 ) and 25 to 34 years ( p\n< 0.005 ) ; however , there was no significant change for women 35 years or older ( p = 0.06 ) ( figure 5 ) .\nwe examined the association between excisional treatment and the c - quip program in two ways .\nfirstly the rate of all excisional treatments ( loop excision + cone biopsy ) per high - grade diagnosis ( cin2 + cin3 + adenocarcinoma in situ ) was calculated across the study period . using this comparison ,\nthe smaller mbs dataset revealed falls across all three age - bands ( figure 6 ) .\nthe aihw procedural dataset also revealed significant reductions in the rate for women in all age groups ( figure 7 ) .\nsecondly , to examine the rate of loop excision alone we calculated the rates using all nonglandular histological diagnoses ( lgea + hgea ) as the denominator in both datasets . in the mbs dataset\nhowever , the c - quip epoch was not associated with any change in the rate of loop excision in any age group : 20 to 24 years ( p = 0.29 ) ; 25 to 34 years ( p = 0.21 ) ; and 35 years or more ( p = 0.34 ) . in the aihw dataset there was no change in the rate in any age group ; the c - quip epoch was not associated with any change ( figure 9 ) .\nin australia over the last decade there has been a decline in the incidence of low - grade squamous dysplasia across all age groups , particularly noticeable in women aged 20 to 24 years .\nthe incidence of high - grade squamous dysplasia has also fallen in young women , with the fall in rate beginning well before any plausible effect from the vaccination program , but with slight but significant increases in older age groups .\nthe rate of glandular abnormality remained unchanged in women aged 20 to 24 years and those aged 35 years or older , although there has been a significant increase in women aged 25 to 34 years . at a population level ,\nthe incidence rate of excisional treatments has fallen significantly in women aged less than 35 years . however , while the mbs dataset revealed small but significant reductions in the rate of loop excision per diagnosis of squamous dysplasia , the aihw showed no significant changes .\nthe c - quip epoch was not associated with a fall in the rate of excisional treatment in any age group .\na strength of this study is that it has used multiple national databases to build up a picture of the trends in excisional treatment of squamous and glandular dysplasia .\nhowever , it has not been possible to examine the use of ablation treatments ( such as radical diathermy or laser ) .\nthe use of excisional treatment for cervical dysplasia is an important component of cervical cancer prevention , but we have been unable to identify any published studies examining trends in the incidence rate of excisional treatment in other countries . for this reason it is difficult to determine whether the national trends found in australia are consistent with changes in clinical practice elsewhere in the world .\nit is noteworthy that the reduction in the use of excisional treatment in younger women began before the introduction of the national hpv vaccination program in 2007 .\nperceptions of potential overuse of excisional treatment in nulliparous women , and indeed for young women whose family is not yet complete , prompted initiation of the c - quip program .\nsystematic reviews suggest that loop excision is associated with an increased risk of subsequent preterm birth   and an increased risk of miscarriage in the second trimester .\nthe risk for preterm birth appears to be increased after loop excision , irrespective of the histopathology being treated , and is highest after repeat procedures .\nyoung women diagnosed with high - grade cervical dysplasia are commonly affected by other confounding factors predisposing them to preterm birth .\nwomen who have undergone excisional treatment are more likely to have a shorter midtrimester cervical length ; however the question of whether depth or volume of tissue excised influences the risk of preterm birth remains unresolved .\nsome studies indicate a direct relationship   while others suggest the association may be a consequence of confounding and not a direct result of treatment .\nlarge excisions , thicker than 1.2  cm and larger than 6  cm , have been associated with a three times greater risk for preterm birth   and there appears to be an association between a short interval between excisional treatment and conception and adverse pregnancy outcomes [ 13 , 14 ] .\nthere does not appear to be any evidence that treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia adversely affects fertility   or results in other adverse pregnancy outcomes .\nthe use of hpv vaccination programs in developed countries has been associated with significant population - level reductions in the incidence of high - grade squamous cervical dysplasia in young women .\nhowever , it remains unresolved whether this is a true result of immunization or reflects reduced uptake of screening .\na population study from denmark , where participation in cervical screening is high , has revealed a reduction in the incidence of invasive squamous carcinoma in older women , with no changes in younger women as yet , and an increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma in young women [ 17 , 18 ] . a similar study from the province of british columbia in canada examined the rates of cervical dysplasia before and after introduction of an hpv vaccination program and reported a significant reduction in high - grade squamous lesions in young women despite vaccine uptake levels below 70% .\nauthors have suggested that , based on the changing pattern of cervical dysplasia in young vaccinated women , initial management of screen - detected abnormalities in young women should consist of cytologic and colposcopic surveillance in the first instance .\nthe national program to vaccinate young australian women against high - risk strains of hpv has been widely embraced , with high levels of coverage with the full three doses in the target population .\nthe program already has been associated with reductions in the prevalence of hpv vaccine - related infections in young women , a reduction in genital warts , and a reduction in high - grade cervical lesions in this age group .\nthe australian national cervical screening program is soon to change from cytology to primary screening for high -

the back - pocket glu-245 , lys-232 , \n and asp-351 can be found , whereas asp-290 is close to the amino group \n of the solvent exposed residues .\nthey captured the thermodynamic \n behavior of the different ligands and binding poses by performing \n docking studies and analyzing solvent molecules around the protein \n using szmap and watermap .\nit was claimed that binding pose d can be explained \n by the replacement of a  happy \nwater molecules has usually a negative contribution to the free energy \n of binding because they have a lower free energy than bulk waters . \n\nhence , the replacement of these water molecules is unfavorable in \n terms of binding free energy , and therefore that \n interpretation is doubtful . in this study\n, we present a theoretical \n paper of the thermodynamics of these binding poses to clarify the \n unexpected behavior of the five ligands and to shed light on the question \n why compound c is not found in the same binding pose as compound d \n and vice versa . to correctly describe the thermodynamics of \n ligand binding ,\nit \n is necessary to study not only the direct enthalpic interactions of \n the ligand and the protein but also to account for differences in \n the solvation of the formed complexes .\nthe ( de)solvation of the protein \n binding site and the ligand can be an important driving force for \n the biomolecular recognition of a ligand and can be as important as \n the direct contact between protein and ligand .\nthis versatile \n behavior of water in binding pockets attracted the attention of the \n scientific field , which resulted in an increasing number of publications \n concerning the analysis of water molecules in ligand - binding with \n a vast variety of different techniques , making it one of the \nfurthermore , it is also \n necessary to calculate both enthalpic and \n entropic contributions , because the free energy is generally not correlated \n to the enthalpy or the entropy alone . in this contribution\n, we analyze the different binding modes in \n terms of thermodynamics and decompose the ( binding ) free energy into \n entropic and enthalpic contributions of the complex and the solvent \n molecules .\nwe use molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in combination \n with \n grid inhomogeneous solvation theory ( gist ) and \n the liner interaction energy ( lie ) module of \n ambertools15 to analyze the thermodynamic properties of the ligand \n binding poses . to estimate the protonation of all ligands we perform \n pka calculations because results are expected \n to depend on the protonation state of the ligands .\nonly the combination \n of these computational methods allows us to explain the experimental \n observed binding pose changes in great detail .\nto capture the complete thermodynamics of the ligand binding process  including \n the flip in the binding pose from compound c to d ( figure 1)we have to use an \n amalgam of analyses tools .\nthe \n two ligand fragments \n ( compound c and d ) in their neutral and positively charged form were \n parametrized using the antechamber module of the amber package with the am1-bcc charge model and the general amber force field ( partial \n charges for all ligands are shown in figures s1s4 ) .\nin addition to the crystal structures , structures of compounds \n c and d in the other possible binding pose were modeled .\nthe two ligands were simulated in both protonation states and in both \n binding poses in complex with the tgfbr1 kinase domain using experimental \n crystal structures ( pdb : 4x2k , 4x2 g ) and as unbound ligands in solution . in total , eight simulations \n of the ligands in complex with the protein were performed plus four \n simulations of the unbound ligands .\nall ligand protein complexes \n were solvated with tip4p water molecules \n in an octahedral box .\nperiodic boundary conditions were applied and \n a minimum distance of 15  between the solute and the edge of \n the box was chosen .\nequilibration of the systems was performed according \n to an established protocol previously developed in our group .\na langevin thermostat was used to keep the temperature \n at 300 k. the pressure of 1 bar was kept by using an isotropic implementation \n of the berendsen barostat .\nthe time step was set to 2 fs and coordinates \n were saved every 10 ps for a 200 ns trajectory without restraints .\nfive representative conformations were obtained by clustering a \n 200 ns trajectory of each ligand using a hierarchical agglomerative \n ( bottom - up ) approach implemented in cpptraj .\nfive clusters were used as we had to find a compromise between calculation \n effort and accuracy .\nthe 2000 water molecules closest to the complex \n of every representative conformer were retained , they were again solvated \n in an octahedral box and equilibrated . during equilibration and simulation \n of the five clusters we applied\ncoordinate restraints to the whole \n protein and the ligand , as it is required for the gist analysis .\nevery cluster was simulated for 100 ns and coordinates \n were saved every 100 ps .\nthe method \n calculates the free energy of water molecules on a grid based approach \n for a single conformation of the solute .\nrecently published studies \n highlighted that gist is a valid and useful approach to study biomolecular \n systems in combination with molecular dynamics simulations , allowing one to differentiate between entropic and enthalpic contributions \n to the total free energy .\nfor all calculated values , the references \n state , to which all values refer , is pure water .\na detailed description \n of how entropic and enthalpic terms are calculated is given by nguyen \n et al . in all our calculations ,\n, the free energy \n of solvation of a solute gsolv can \n be written according to eq 1.1it is defined as the integral over \n the solvation \n free energies gsolv(q ) of a solute determined for each of its conformations q times the probability p(q ) to find \n the solute in this conformation . to calculate gsolv(q ) for a particular conformation q ,\nin this paper we consider the occurrence of different relevant conformations \n by simulating an unrestraint complex system .\nequation 1 is used to calculate the \n solvation free energy gsolv from \n the solvation free energies of the five restrained solute conformers \n gsolv(q ) ( the integral \n is approximated with a discrete sum ) .\nthe probabilities p(q ) are the relative cluster sizes , i.e. , the number \n of structures per cluster .\nwe want to emphasize that gist covers the thermodynamic \n properties of the water only and it does not cover the entropic and \n enthalpic differences of the ligand and the protein upon binding . \n\nas continuous \n grids are difficult to visualize , we tried to enhance the visualization \n of our results by extracting the most abundant water positions from \n the grid values .\nto find sensible water positions , a script \n was written to search \n for the grid point with the highest water density .\nfrom this grid \n point and the surrounding grid points the density of one water molecule \n is subtracted .\nafterward , the next most abundant grid point is found \n by the program and again the density of one water molecule is subtracted . \n\na 1% residual density is \n necessary due to boundary effects . to assign thermodynamic values \n to the refined water positions ,\nthe thermodynamic value ( e.g. , entropy , \n enthalpy , or free energy ) of the analyzed grid points are averaged \n ( density weighted ) .\nfigure 3 shows the results for the total entropy of the water molecules \n in a grid representation ( a ) and with representative water molecules \n ( b ) .\neach depicted water molecule has an entropy value larger than \n 3.5 kcal / mol .\nan analogous procedure can be applied to all other thermodynamic \n values of the gist output ; see ref ( 17 ) . aside from an easier visualization\nan additional \n advantage of this representation is that less abundant ( less populated ) \n grid points are weighted to a lesser extent and therefore points with \n high entropy due to low occupancy are not overinterpreted .\ncomparison \n of the grid visualization ( a ) and with representative \n water molecule representation ( b ) .\nthe grid points with a high entropic \n penalty ( ts > \n 3.5 \n kcal / mol , pink grid ) and the refined water positions with a high entropic \n penalty ( ts > \n 3.5 \n kcal / mol , blue spheres ) are shown for compound c. results are very \n similar whether refined water positions or raw grid representation \n is used for analysis , but visualization clearly benefits from further \n processing of raw grid results .\nin contrast to the visualization of single water molecules \n and \n their corresponding properties , we also aimed for a quantitative description \n of the binding thermodynamics . therefore , we summed the thermodynamic \n value of interest ( density - weighted ) over all grid points of the ligand \n binding region to capture differences in the overall thermodynamics . \n to ensure that roughly the same volume is used to estimate the water \n properties of the pocket for every simulation ,\nall grid points within \n 5  of the ligand , the asp-290 , or the glu-245 residue ( shown \n in figure 3 ) are used \n to calculate the thermodynamic properties of the pocket . as the gist analysis omits the enthalpic \n interactions between the ligand and the protein ,\ntherefore , we used the lie \n implementation of the ambertools15 package to estimate the enthalpy \n of ligand binding . in lie\n, eq 2 is applied to estimate the free energy of \n solvation:2ul  s describes \n the difference in interaction energy between the \n unbound solvated ligand and the ligand in complex with the protein \n plus solvation .\nif we set the parameters  =  = 1 and \n  = 0 , we obtain the difference in interaction energy u for the ligand in the bound and unbound state . in lie \n\nin contrast , the method with the suggested \n parameters (  =  = 1 and  = 0 ) is a measure for \n the change in interaction enthalpy between the ligand in the bound \n and in the unbound state . therefore , this method includes the interaction \n of the ligand with the protein , which is not captured by the gist \n analysis .\nthis method was further used to analyze the difference in \n the binding enthalpy between a protonated and the neutral form of \n the ligands c and d. implicit \n solvent calculations can be employed for the calculation \n of pka values . we make use of the openeye \n software protein_pka which is based on their poisson \nthe actual pka value is derived from a thermodynamic cycle : the solvation \n energy of the protonated and deprotonated form of the residue ( amino \n acid or ligand ) is computed by solving the poisson \nboltzmann \n equation whereas the pka value of the \n residue in aqueous solution is taken from literature or experiment . \n\nhowever , sampling of the different possibilities \n of the charge states ( residue 1 protonated and residue 2 protonated , \n residue 1 protonated and residue 2 deprotonated , etc . ) of the residues \n is necessary : protein_pka makes use of monte carlo sampling to simulate \n the effect of different charge states .\nthe protein structures were \n prepared by protein_pka ( addition of hydrogen atoms and rebuilding \n missing heavy atoms ) .\nas discussed in a previously \n published study by czodrowski et al . \n the role of water molecules in the proximity of the binding pocket \n can play a significant role in explaining the two different binding \n modes . to simplify the complex process \n of solvation , we distinguish in a first approximation between water \n molecules with a negative and a positive free energy value compared \n with water molecules in bulk .\nif the free energy of the water molecule \n is more positive than in bulk water , we can gain free energy of binding \n when the water is removed from the protein and released into bulk . \n\nwater molecules with a positive free energy value in comparison to \n bulk water are either entropically constrained , i.e. , restricted in \n their movement with no or too low enthalpic compensation ( entropically \n unfavored water position , e.g. , formation of a water wire or water \n polygons in an apolar environment ) , or have in general too low enthalpic \n interactions in comparison with bulk water ( enthalpically unfavored \n water position , e.g. , hydrophobic pocket ) . water molecules with a negative free energy value compared to bulk \n water often show strong enthalpic interactions .\nthese strong enthalpic \n interactions lead to a highly favorable enthalpy of solvation . however , \n the phase space that these enthalpically strong bound water molecules \n can occupy ( e.g. , water near a charged residue ) is usually restricted , \n resulting in a low entropy contribution .\ntherefore , the very favorable \n enthalpy of solvation is partially compensated by entropic restrictions . \n\nthis phenomenon is called entropy - enthalpy compensation . as neither enthalpy nor entropy is able to describe the differences \n in free energy completely ,\nit is necessary \n to investigate both enthalpy and entropy to identify water molecules \n with a positive free energy contribution . to explain why compound \n c is not found in pose d and vice versa , \n analyses of all possible binding poses and different protonation states \n were performed ( summarized in figure 4 )\nonce more we would like to point out that the two \n ligands only differ in the position of the amino group , which is in \n para - position in compound c and in meta - position in d. overview of all investigated \n structures .\ncompound c as crystallized \n ( pose c ) and compound d as found in the crystal structure ( pose d ) \n ( gray box ) . to explain the surprising binding mode flip an analysis \n of compound d in pose c and vice versa ( red box )\nis also required . \n to rationalize the complete binding behavior we also have to account \n for the possibility of different protonation states of the ligands \n within the binding pocket ( blue boxes ) .\nwe start the thermodynamic analysis by investigating the \n free energy \n contributions of water molecules for the four uncharged states ( red \n box of figure 4 ) . as \n already pointed out by czodrowski et al .\nthe differences between compound c and d in terms of physicochemical \n properties are very subtle at first glance .\nredocking for both compounds \n was successful but when compound d was docked into the crystal structure \n of compound c binding pose c was obtained .\nthe same result was obtained \n for the cross - docking of compound c into the crystal structure of \n compound d. to rationalize the binding behavior we started with \n analyzing the \n solvent structure of the neutral ligands in the binding pose from \n the crystal structure and in the docked binding pose .\nvisualization of water entropies from the gist \n calculation for \n compounds c and d in both binding poses .\nblue spheres indicate water \n molecules with a low / unfavorable entropy ( ts > 3.5 kcal / mol ) in a radius of 5  \n around the ligands and the shown asp-290 and glu-245 residues . for \n both compounds binding\npose c reveals more entropically disfavored \n water molecules in the back - pocket ( highlighted with red ovals ) .\nentropically unfavorable water \n sites in respect to bulk water ( ts > 3.5 kcal / mol ) are shown in figure 5 as blue spheres . \n for compound d ( figure 5 : bottom )\nwe find that the binding pose d ( left ) has significantly \n fewer entropically unfavorable water molecules than binding pose c \n ( right ) .\nthus , for compound d the binding pose d is entropically favored \n over pose c. some of these entropically unfavorable water molecules \n do not show strong enthalpic interactions with the ligand or the protein \n or other water molecules .\nthe free energy of these water molecule \n is high in comparison to bulk water molecules . in the buried pocket \n ( red oval in figure 5 )\nsuch water molecules with a positive contribution to the free energy \n are found , which can be replaced by a ligand , as found for compound \n d in pose d. however , also for compound c binding pose d shows \n significantly \n fewer ordered water molecules ( figure 5 : top ) , indicating that our analysis is missing important \n details for this ligand . to shed light on this behavior , enthalpic \n and entropic contributions to solvation as well as the resulting free \n energy of water molecules within\nthe previously mentioned 5  \n radius to the binding pocket are studied and results listed in table 1 .\nthe first four rows list \n the results of the gist calculations for \n the uncharged ligands . for compound\nd we find that pose d is energetically \n favorable ( gd(pose d ) < gd(pose c ) ) and that this difference in free \n energy has its origin in the water entropy .\nthis is in good agreement \n with the visualization and the results obtained earlier by czodrowski \n et al . the solvent calculations with watermap \n and szmap also identified two to three  unhappy/hydrophobic  \n\nwater molecules which are replaced by compound d in the buried pocket . \n as a reminder : \nunhappy/hydrophilic water molecules \n correspond to water molecules with a positive free energy value compared \n with bulk water .\nthis explains the binding mode of compound d but \n would also mean that compound c should be found in the crystal structure \n with binding pose d. the free energy for compound c in pose d is also \n lower than in pose c ( gc(pose d ) \n < gc(pose c ) . the previously \n published explanation that the displacement of an enthalpically strong \n bound water molecule is responsible for this change in the binding \n is doubtful , as this should lead to a decrease in binding affinity .\nthese results indicate that the binding pose of compound c can not \n be explained by solvation analysis alone . therefore\n, further investigation \n of the binding of the ligand c is required . a more detailed investigation \n of the binding site and the residues in close proximity to the ligand \n revealed that the binding site shows two negatively charged residues \n ( asp-351 , glu-245 ) in the buried pocket together with a positively \n charged lysine ( lys-232 ) , forming salt bridges with each other .\nfurthermore , \n a negatively charged aspartate ( asp-290 ) is close to the amino group \n of the solvent exposed ligand .\nhence , protonation of the aniline group \n and formation of a salt bridge with the deprotonated aspartate residue \n ( shown in figure 6 ) \n could occur as no other positively charged group is in close proximity .\npossible \n salt bridge formed between the negatively charged aspartate \n ( asp-290 ) residue and the positively charged amino group of ligand \n c. we therefore performed pka calculations \n for the compounds c and d for their native x - ray pose as well as their \n docking pose .\nthe reported values correspond \n to the pka values of the amino group in \n compounds c and d. amino \n group is definitely not protonated \n at physiological ph : this can be concluded due to the pka value which is computed to be below 0 .\nthe results of the pka calculations \n showed that indeed compound c in binding pose c is likely protonated , \n whereas for all other structures it is unlikely that the ligands are \n protonated at neutral ph .\ntherefore , we performed the gist calculations \n for the protonated \n form of the ligands c and d ( table 1 ; row 58 ) . again the entropy for binding pose \n d is higher than for pose c. in terms of free energy the compounds \n show the correct trend , but the difference between the different compounds \n and the different binding poses are smaller than for the neutral compounds . \n as the method s error ( max standard error of the mean for the \n gist calculation : 3.1 kcal / mol ) is in the same range , we have to further \n investigate the system to ensure the trend is correct .\nthe enthalpic \n interactions between two charged residues ( only present with a positively \n charged ligand ) are significantly stronger than interactions between \n a charge and a dipole or two dipoles . since gist\ndoes not cover the \n interaction energy between ligand and protein this could further help \n to explain the binding mode .\ntherefore , we hypothesize that the strong \n enthalpic interaction of the salt bridge in the solvent exposed binding \n mode overcompensates the entropic unfavorable contributions of the \n ordered water molecules in the buried pocket . to ensure that \n the pka calculations \n are correct ,\nwe present further evidence that the ligand is indeed \n protonated and this is responsible for the binding mode flip .\nunfortunately , \n protonation states usually can not be determined by x - ray crystallography \n for most biomolecular systems and techniques sensitive to proton location , \n like neutron scattering , are rarely used within drug design projects . \n\nhowever , by looking at pka values for \n related molecules it becomes evident that p - phenylenediamine \n is significantly more basic ( pka = 6.2 ) \n than the m - phenylenediamine with a pka of 4.98 , indicating \n that compound c is much easier to protonate than compound d at physiological \n ph .\nthis is corroborated by the pka calculations \n of the protein - complex . in terms of biomolecular recognition\nthe position \n of the amino group in para - position ( n  o distance 2.8  ) \n is closer to the carboxyl group of the aspartate than the amino group \n in the meta - position ( n  o distance 3.5  ) .\nthe difference \n in the pka values might also influence \n the solvation thermodynamics as the amount of the respective protonated \n species differ between the two compounds .\nhowever , the absolute number \n of protonated species is considered small and therefore these contributions \n are likely to be minor without a stabilizing functional group in vicinity . \n\nwhile at the first glance the change of the amino group from ortho- \n to meta - position does not seem to be significant , it fundamentally \n changed the properties of the molecule . to further analyze the \n idea that the compound can be protonated \n we used the lie tool of the ambertools package .\nwe wanted to choose a method which explicitly includes \n the interaction of the protein and the ligand , as this kind of interaction \n is omitted by the gist analysis . to obtain the difference between \n the interaction energy of the \n ligand in complex and as free ligand two simulations were necessary . \n\nfurther , we are interested in the change of binding energy \n between protonated and unprotonated state ( shown in the last two columns \n of table 3 ) .\nas expected , \n the results show that the interaction between the ligand and the surrounding \n ( protein and water ) is enhanced when the ligand is protonated for \n both binding poses . still , the gain in ( more favorable ) interaction \n energy for position c ( 15.8 kcal / mol ) is higher compared to \n the gain in pose d ( 10.8 kcal / mol ) for compound c. it is likely \n that this gain in enthalpy is responsible for the binding pose change . \n for binding pose c\nthis enthalpic gain helps to compensate the entropic \n penalty of the water molecules in the buried pocket and therefore \n stabilizing the binding pose of compound c. for both binding poses \n of compound d , we see a gain in interaction energy similarly to compound \n c in position c ( 16.2 and 16.0 kcal / mol ) . in contrast to compound \n c , compound d is much more difficult to protonate and therefore the \n energy gain may not be enough to compensate for the energy necessary \n for the protonation . looking at table 3 from a different angle : although we already see that \n in the neutral \n form compound c slightly prefers pose c ( 1.9 kcal / mol ) , this \n could be in the range of the method s error .\nthe preference \n enhances for the positive form of compound c and is significantly \n larger ( 7.0 kcal / mol ) than the error of the method . for compound \n d\n, we found a preference for pose d over pose c ( 5.0 kcal / mol ) \n for both the positive and neutral form .\nfurther evidence that \n the preference of the neutral compound c \n for pose c is not significant brought the application of the mm / pbsa \n method to this problem . with this method we found that \n compound c prefers pose d in the unprotonated state by 6 kcal / mol , \n whereas for the charged compound we could not find any preference \n (  < 1 kcal / mol ) for one of the two binding poses .\nthis finding further supports \n our hypothesis that compound c has to be protonated , when it is found \n in pose c. enthalpy ( lie ) calculations without solvent and further \n information \n about the mm / gb(pb)sa calculations are given in the si .\nto summarize : binding pose d is favorable for compound \n d , not only \n but also due to entropic contributions from the water molecules being \n ( the phase space water molecules can occupy ) more favorable than in \n pose c. hence , the binding pose of compound d is to a large extend \n determined by the entropic contribution of the water molecules .\nthis \n explains how water can influence the affinity and specificity of ligand \n binding sites .\nthe importance of water \n for ligand binding is already well established . in the presented case\nthe replacement of entropically hindered \n water with respect to bulk results in a gain in free energy .\nin contrast , \n there are cases reported in literature where the enthalpy gain by \n formation of a water mediated hydrogen bond is larger than the entropic \n cost of restricting the phase space of the water molecules . for binding pose c\n, the entropy of the \n water molecules in the binding \n pocket is unfavorable in comparison to the water molecules in pose \n d , but compound c is protonated , leading to strong enthalpic interactions . \n\nour findings confirm once more that ligand binding depends \n on the balance between entropy and enthalpy .\nthe relative importance \n of the enthalpic and entropic contribution might change dramatically \n upon subtle modifications in ligand chemistry .\nour study also highlights \n the already known fact that enthalpy alone is not a good measurement \n for free energy , a fact often forgotten \n in medicinal chemistry when focusing solely on direct protein \nfurthermore , the ph effect on binding affinities and \n binding modes \n is often neglected . indeed\nthe pka of \n a ligand influences the binding affinity and selectivity , but also \n the binding of a ligand affects the pka of the ligand and the protein , as shown \n in this study .\nour analysis shows that \n the combination of in silico analysis tools \n can unravel the origin of different binding poses .\nthe present study \n provides an explanation of binding modes and rationalizes , based on \n thermodynamics , the observed binding mode flips .\nwe show how a minor \n change in the structure of a ligand leads to major structural changes , \n which could result in a misinterpretation of structure  activity \n relationships .\nthe binding pose of compound d is by a large extend \n determined by releasing entropically unfavored ( with respect to bulk \n water ) water molecules from the binding pocket into bulk upon binding . \n for a second compound c , very similar to the first one ,\nthe enthalpic interactions that play a key role in one of the binding \n poses are strongly related to the protonation of the amino group in \n this ligand . we encourage to carefully investigate protonation states , \n if functional groups are present which may or may not be protonated \n in the environment of another charged group with opposite sign .\nseemingly \n subtle changes in the chemical structure can significantly alter the \n physicochemical properties of certain groups . as the obtained results \n go beyond the limit of chemical intuition , the computational methodology \n presented can be of value for medicinal chemistry programs .\nthe enhanced thermodynamic understanding \n of such binding flips \n can help to improve binding pose prediction of unknown ligands . while \n we have to admit that the extensive study presented here is most likely \n beyond the scope of typical drug design programs , the ligand binding \n poses analyzed here\nwould most likely not have been correctly predicted \n by any state - of - the - art structure - based drug design methodology .\nnevertheless , \n such challenging cases can be used to strengthen our ability to accurately \n predict binding

consistent condom use ( i.e. , every time ) in the past month and at most recent anal sex were lower in younger participants ( 53.8% and 78.1% , respectively ) than older participants ( 60.2% and 82.7% , respectively ) .\nthis study investigated the sexual behavior of chinese msm population using a questionnaire with rrts .\ndifferent rrt models were used with the intention to obtain more honest responses to three kinds of sensitive questions . to the best of our knowledge ,\nthis is the first time that diverse rrt models have been used to investigate both quantitative and qualitative behavioral characteristics in chinese msm population .\nthe participation rate of 95% in this rrt survey is higher than that reported in studies using anonymous telephone survey ( 57% ) or anonymous structured questionnaire in direct interviews ( 89.5% ) .\nthe high anonymity resulting from the survey techniques may have removed participants concerns in compromising their privacy and , therefore , contributed to the high participation rate .\nother factors such as the short length of the questionnaire and peer - referral recruitment mechanism may have further encouraged participation in this study .\nthe rrt estimate of age at the first sexual encounter with a male partner in our study is 21.7 years , which is younger than that reported by a study using a direct interview with an anonymous questionnaire in a cross - sectional survey of the msm population in eastern china .\na case  control study on the msm population in southwestern china reported that the average age at the first sexual encounter with a man among the hiv - positive cases was 21.7 years , compared with 22.0 years among the hiv - negative controls .\nour estimate of the age related to msm debut homosexual encounter using rrt is the same as that for the hiv - positive cases , but slightly younger than that for the hiv - negative controls reported in the case  control study . for the number of male sex partners in the past month ,\na study among migrant msm in beijing reported that the median number of male sex partners was 3 in the past 6 months , which is close to our estimate but the reporting period is much longer than that of our study .\nother studies reported more sex partners among chinese msm population in the period of the past 6 months before the survey .\nan online survey conducted among msm in beijing reported that the median number of male sex partners in the past 6 months was 5 whereas the overall median number of male sex partners of chinese msm in the past 6 months was estimated to be 1.5 by a review article based on the studies published during 20002010 .\nin addition to the difference in reporting period , some studies were conducted several years earlier than the current study and the pattern of sexual behavior among msm population may have changed with time .\nmost studies on condom use among msm population in china reported the pattern of use at last sexual act and consistent use in a 6-month period . a study among 20,843 msm in 16 cities in china\nreported that self - reported condom use at last homosexual encounter increased from 58% in 2006 to 81% in 2009 whereas the consistent condom use rate in the past 6 months increased from 28% to 49% during the same period . in china 's united nations general assembly special session ( ungass )\nreport 2010 , the estimated rate of condom use at last anal sex among msm surveyed in sentinel surveillance programs was 73.1% .\nour rrt estimate of consistent condom use in the past month is higher than that reported in 2009 in the aforementioned study .\nhowever , the shorter length of reporting period ( i.e. , 1 month ) may contribute to the higher estimate in our study , as it is obviously more challenging to be a consistent condom user for 6 months than for only 1 month . a more recent study on money boys ( i.e. , male sex workers engaging in same - sex sexual activities for economic benefits ) reported 80.2% of the participants used condoms consistently with male sex partners in the past 3 months , which is much higher than the rrt estimate of consistent condom use in our study .\nthis may be caused by the selection of a special study population ( i.e. , money boys ) perceiving higher risks and , therefore , more protective behavior . for condom use at last anal sex with a male partner ,\nour rrt estimate is slightly lower than that reported in 2009 ( 81% ) in the same aforementioned study using questionnaire and interview for data collection , but higher than that reported in china 's ungass report 2010 ( 73.1% ) , which used questionnaire for the survey at sentinels across the whole country .\nconsistent condom use has been proven an effective behavioral strategy to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted infections ( stis ) and/or hiv and remains the most effective barrier method against hiv transmission . in china ,\npublic health programs targeting msm population were launched more than a decade ago , and condom use was included in the majority of these programs .\nthis may have resulted in the increasing use of condoms among msm to protect against hiv and stis as reflected in the relatively high rrt estimate of condom use at last sex with a male partner in our study . moreover ,\nthe risks of the behavioral characteristics investigated in this study were consistently higher in msm aged < 30 years ( i.e. , having earlier first sexual encounter , more number of sex partners and lower rate of consistent condom use in the past month , and lower rate of condom use at most recent anal sex ) than older msm . nonetheless , such phenomenon was not observed in this population for other demographic features such as marital status ( single vs. married ) , residence ( beijing resident vs. non - beijing resident ) , length of residence in beijing ( < 2 years vs.  2 years ) , ethnicity ( han vs. minorities ) , and education ( high school or below vs. college or above ) . for these\nabove mentioned demographic characteristics , the risks were higher in a subpopulation for some but not all behavioral characteristics under studied .\nthis suggests that younger msm population ( aged < 30 years ) may be a priority target for intervention programs aiming to reduce the risk behaviors investigated by our study . in summary , this study explored the profile of risk behaviors among msm population in beijing by employing a questionnaire with rrt in a sample of participants .\ncompared with the survey using anonymous questionnaires or direct interviews , the msm population in the current survey using rrt started their first sexual encounter at a younger age had more male partners and lower rate of consistent condom use during anal sex with male partners , especially in younger msm aged < 30 years .\nthese results suggest that rrt might be a useful tool to obtain more truthful feedback on sensitive information such as sexual behavior from the respondents\n. meanwhile , rrt might be particularly valuable in traditional chinese settings where msm are trying to avoid the stigma incurred and , therefore , incline to respond evasively to conventional direct questionnaires or interviews .\nthe participants of the study were recruited through peer - referrals and internet advertisements which may result in a sample with limited representativeness and reflect the difference of rrt estimate as compared to the estimate using conventional survey techniques .\nmoreover , we did not collect the data using a direct questionnaire simultaneously and thus could not compare the results from the direct questionnaire and that from rrt in the same study population .\nbesides , due to the nature of rrt , participant - level data are not available from the rrt survey and , therefore , preclude more detailed analysis based on individual data .\nfurthermore , the reporting period concerning sexual behavior with male partners and condom use was designed as 1 month , which is different from the period of 6 months used in most studies and makes difficult comparison of the results with other similar studies .\nsupplementary information is linked to the online version of the paper on the chinese medical journal website .\nthis work was supported by the national natural science foundation

whether there were consequences in male offspring remains to be ascertained .\nmore recently , models such as the agouti mouse have shown that transgenerational influences can result in offspring predisposed to a pathological state such as obesity , in itself a grave predisposing factor for chronic morbidities .   with more populations globally adopting a westernized lifestyle (\nthat which could be associated with living in northern / western europe and usa ) , there is the real possibility for a sudden surge in cancers of the breast , colon , prostate , and uterus in areas that hitherto would not have seen large rates of incidence of these conditions ; in many of these regions , the question will be whether there will be a healthcare infrastructure capable of coping with markedly increased numbers of cases and , capable of providing appropriate treatment and after - patient care . as far back as the 1960 's\n, there was recognition of worldwide region - specific differences in breast cancer incidence and , correlations between calorie , protein or fat consumption , and risk were noted .\neven then , in addition to environmental carcinogen exposures , a hormone - mediated difference in susceptibility to breast cancer among us - resident women of different ethnic backgrounds was observed .\nbreast adipose tissue may act as a reservoir for lipophilic genotoxic carcinogens [ 12 , 13 ] , but still there is likely a requirement for a hormone - driven event   that develops or evolves with a phenotypic change associated with lifestyle .  \ndiet predisposes children from ethnically diverse populations resident in the usa to chronic conditions such as cancer later in life ; this same early - life influence is noted in the uk [ 14 , 15 ] .\nthe question then is whether due to differing environmental and/or lifestyle changes , a phenotypic change occurs in migrants to western regions ( e.g. , northern / western europe and usa ) and their children ( i.e. , the f0/f1 generations ) , and this then not so much enhances vulnerability as a mutation might , but creates accessibility to critical target sites ( e.g. , tumour suppressor genes ( tsgs ) and oncogenes ) in the genome of subsequent generations ( table 1 ) . as a consequence the f2/f3/and so forth generations inherit a structurally vulnerable genome ; this may be to allow increased growth and physicality associated with western lifestyle , but it could also open up the potential for genomic accessibility with consequent cycles of chemical - dna adduct formation and potentially faulty repair .\nthis parental priming of the genome template could be termed a genomic susceptibility organizational structure ( sos ) ; within this model , later generations do not inherit predisposing mutations but a chromatin organization that allows critical genes to be better targeted by dna - damaging agents of environmental and/or dietary origin .  \nenvironmental and/or lifestyle factors alter the epigenome of the f0/f1 generation amongst a migrant population to a high - risk region ; these inherited epigenetic alterations would then predispose the genome of subsequent generations . this hypothesised model would explain why epidemiological studies to date have failed to identify causative factors for breast or prostate cancers although migration , hormone factors , calorie / protein / fat consumption , and exposure to carcinogens have been variously implicated .\nthis review sets out to delineate a potential role for transgenerational epigenetic influences in the aetiology of breast and prostate cancer , cancers arising from these sites being more complex than more directly targeted tissues such as the lung , colon or stomach .\nit will also highlight that conventional epidemiological studies that typically set out to establish cause ( or susceptible genotype ) and effect , will be severely limited in their scope under this paradigm .\nhowever , it also shows why with ever increasingly large studies more robust associations with environmental causes are noted .\nepigenetic alterations include modifications in dna methylation , posttranslational influences on histone morphology / code ( i.e. , proteins forming the nucleosome core of chromatin and pivotal in structural packaging of dna ) , nucleosome positioning and , the profile of micrornas ( mirnas ) and noncoding rnas [ 1618 ] .\nthe most - studied alteration to date is methylation at the 5 position of cytosines mediated by dna methyltransferases ( dnmt ) , predominantly in cytosine - guanine dinucleotide ( cpg ) sites ; this generates 5-methylcytosine ( 5-mec ) , and if it occurs at sites that occupy the promoter regions of genes , this hypermethylation is correlated with transcriptional silencing .  \nmethylation can result in complete transcriptional repression of tsgs such as p16 ; if detected early enough , the specificity of this methylation pattern could be predictive for cancer types occurring at a particular or different sites [ 20 , 21 ] .\nthis has led to the development of quantitative methylation - specific pcr analyses to determine the methylation status of a panel of candidate tsgs in order to determine if one can triage for certain cancers .\nsuch methylation patterns may throw up new differentially expressed gene candidates in cancer , some of which may even be free of mutations .\nthese observations herald the possibility of epigenetic blood - based biomarkers linked to the underlying mechanism of a specific cancer pathogenesis ; it opens up possibilities of novel early screening tools .  \nalthough methylation status is currently the most - studied epigenetic marker , there is increasing recognition that other modifications such as those of the histone code can modify the chromatin organization in such a way as to influence in a dominant fashion regional mutation - rate ; this could be a pivotal observation to be translated to the notion of the evolution of a genomic sos in humans .\nhistone deacetylases are now recognized to play a role in the control of the dna damage responses at several levels .\nwhat is compelling is that these structural chromatin alterations can be inherited ; this remodelled genome must influence the offspring 's susceptibility to damage events following carcinogen exposures in their lifetime , that is , a genomic sos .\nmetabolic signals play a critical role in determining chromatin structure ; thus one can surmise that given a markedly different lifestyle , the same genotype could generate a markedly different phenotype through the evolution of differing profiles of epigenetic marking of the genome .\nwhen migrants arrive in a new region , an initially slowly - adopted diet and/or lifestyle will then impact on the organizational structure and relative compaction of their offspring 's chromatin ( figure 2 ) .\nmigrants from the far east to northern / western europe may see their children / grandchildren grow more than those with similar genotypes in previous generations ; this may be looked upon as a beneficial health outcome , but does this have an impact on the accessibility of their genome to genotoxic exposures of dietary and/or environmental origin ? studies of evolution have suggested that epigenetic drivers have underpinned dramatic changes in developmental biology , an example being that of cognitive function , to a far greater extent than genetic variability\n. persistent physical exercise will modify the epigenome , which will alter phenotype ; likewise , diet and/or lifestyle will undoubtedly play a significant role in this process too .   of additional recent interest\nalthough their biology and function still remain mostly obscure , they are believed to have core functions in a wide range of cellular processes , through interaction with key component proteins in the gene regulatory system .\nalterations of their cell- or tissue - specific expression and/or their primary or secondary structures are thought to promote cell proliferation , invasion , and metastasis .\nmirnas comprise a family of small , endogenous , noncoding functional rna molecules that have emerged as key posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression ; they may again be useful biomarkers for early detection of disease - related molecular and genetic changes .\nnoncoding mirnas can contribute to cancer development and progression , and are differentially expressed in normal tissues compared to cancers ; their expression signature may define cancer gene targets   or be diagnostic of the cancer type .\nhowever , not dissimilar to histone modifications , the expression profile of noncoding mirnas constitutes an epigenetic alteration that seems to regulate male gamete production , cns functions , cell cycle and proliferation , and erythrocyte development during haematopoiesis in vertebrates , amongst a plethora of other biological functions and mechanisms . in a mouse model\n, paternal exposure to the procarcinogen benzo[a]pyrene ( b[a]p ) affected the expression of several mirnas , and the target genes for some of the dysregulated mirnas were enriched in many different pathways that are likely to be relevant for the developing embryo .\nthe notion of an expression control by a posttranslational genomic signature generated by a previous generation 's environmental influence , but governing the offspring 's susceptibility , will pose extreme challenges for future epidemiological studies .\nthis does not represent a simple cause - and - effect model within the individual but one modulated by ancestral environmental influences .\nearly - life ( pre- and/or postnatal ) influences on the epigenome appear to modify risk to later - life susceptibility to chronic diseases , including cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and cancer . in a number of animal models , the maternal nutritional environment appears to play a pivotal role in the long - term wellbeing of the offspring ; we are only now beginning to investigate how this might influence the epidemiology of chronic age - related diseases such as cancer in humans .\ncancer is a heterogeneous disease , which we understand now is not only caused by genetic alterations ( e.g. , mutations ) but also by an altered gene expression profile ( i.e. , epigenetic alteration ) . given that we have known for years about a constitutive role for extrahepatic bioactivating enzymes capable of activating procarcinogens [ 42 , 43 ] , differences in expression between different regions or cell populations within the same tissue , and their environmentally-/lifestyle - mediated modifiable nature , the notion that epigenetic influences may also modify their role in cancer aetiology is not unsurprising .\ndifferences in environmental influences mean that older monozygous twins who may have grown up in differing environments ( e.g. , urban versus rural ) exhibit significant discordance in epigenomic markers such as genomic distribution of 5-mec dna and histone acetylation compared to those examined in the early years of life .\nepigenetic changes in dna methylation patterns at cpg sites ( which could be known as epimutations ) may give rise to transgenerational effects , although understanding these phenomena in real - world situations remains a major challenge .\nhowever , the premise of this review is that a transgenerational step is required towards acquiring the elevated risk of breast or prostate cancer observed in north / western europe and the usa .\nthis differs from a more cause - and - effect model seen with lung cancer induced by tobacco smoke , stomach cancer induced by nitrosamines , or hepatocellular carcinoma induced by aflatoxin b1 .\never since valproic acid was identified as a specific histone deacetylase ( hdac ) inhibitor , it has also been speculated that new intervention or therapeutic strategies exploiting agents that also modify transcriptional regulation in the pathogenesis of cancer via the generation of epigenetic alterations could be developed .\nalthough this may convey a novel therapeutic strategy in the presence of disease , it also raises the possibility that continuous low - level exposures to epimutagenic agents might enhance susceptibility to genotoxic mechanisms . a whole range of chemical contaminants found in the human diet and/or environment may modify the epigenomic patterns of cytosine methylation and/or histone acetylation .\nexamples of this are the heavy metals including arsenic , nickel , chromium , and cadmium , which increase cancer incidence ; these are weak mutagens but appear to be potent modifiers of the epigenome . by examining morphological changes in heterochromatin and dna methylation at gene loci in an in vitro early embryo ( mouse ) model , it was shown that selected environmental contaminants , including diethyl phosphate , mercury , cotinine , selenium , and octachlorodipropyl ether induced at low concentrations ( i.e. , ppb ) , marked and sometimes irreversible epigenetic alterations ; given the potential for real - world exposures to such exogenous agents , one might surmise that this could impact human embryological development .\nof course , humans are not exposed to single test agents but are exposed continuously and variously throughout life to a changing cocktail of different contaminants .\nmodelling the potential effects of such mixtures is a challenge , as different test agents might be similarly acting or independently acting [ 57 , 58 ] ; as such , they could act in combination in additive , synergistic , or inhibitory mechanisms . in populations with high exposures to persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) , such as greenlandic inuit ,\nsuch observations make it highly likely that epigens ( i.e. , modifiers of the epigenome ) found routinely in the human diet and/or environment could modify the human epigenome , which could add another level of complexity in the exposure - causation model of classical epidemiological studies .\nif these heritable genomic alterations are a consequence of parental or early - life exposures , they may if they occur greatly enhance subsequent susceptibility to later - life factors in the aetiology of chronic disease .\nthere is an increasing suggestion in the academic literature that exposure to environmental contaminants may play an aetiological role in a range of disease - predisposing conditions , including obesity .\nalthough high - density calorie diet and lack of physical activity might be the primary causes of obesity , endocrine disruptors acting as obesogens could initiate or exacerbate this morbidity [ 61 , 62 ] .\nin addition to endocrine disruptors , there is a growing body of evidence that heavy metals , including nickel , lead , cadmium , arsenic and others , asbestos , and alcohol intake all act to variously modify the potential for epigenetic alterations .\nair pollution constituents , especially particulate matter ( pm ) , appear to alter the profile of mirnas .\npm is known to alter epigenetic markers ( e.g. , dna methylation and histone modifications ) , which may contribute to air - pollution - mediated health consequences including an elevated risk for cardiovascular diseases or events ; identifying individual epigenetic loci associated with dysregulated gene expression following exposure could generate novel intervention strategies mitigating the development of such adverse outcomes .\nin addition , perfluorinated compounds are of significant concern as they bioaccumulate with suggestions that in utero human exposure is associated with global hypomethylation of the genome ; recently , perfluorooctanoic acid - mediated toxicity was associated with aberrant methylation of glutathione - s - transferase pi , a carcinogen - detoxifying enzyme .  \nchemical pollutants , dietary components , temperature changes , and other external stresses can indeed have long - lasting effects on development , metabolism , and health , sometimes even in generations subsequent to the exposed individual .\na growing body of epidemiological evidence demonstrates associations between parental usage ( especially occupational ) of pesticides , particularly insecticides , giving rise to acute lymphocytic leukaemia and brain tumours in offspring .\naccumulating evidence suggests that environmental and occupational exposures to natural substances , as well as man - made chemical and physical agents , play an aetiological role in human cancer ; carcinogenesis may be induced by either genotoxic or nongenotoxic carcinogens ( e.g. , arsenic , 1,3-butadiene ) that also cause prominent epigenetic changes .\ncadmium is a toxic , nonessential transition metal and contributes a health risk to humans , including strong associations between its exposure and various cancers or cardiovascular diseases .\nthis agent has been shown to induce various epigenetic changes in plant and mammalian cells in vitro and in vivo , and this is likely the primary mechanism via which it mediates its toxicity .  \nthe importance of early - life changes towards future susceptibility to chronic age - related diseases is gaining increasing recognition .\nof major concern in this regard are observations that common environmental contaminants such a bisphenol a and phthalates can variously be hypomethylating and alter mirna expression levels or dnmt activities ; the fact that such agents appear to induce low - dose effects postmaternal exposure in the genital tract of female offspring of mice   suggests a phenotype change associated with an epigenetic alteration that has later - life consequences .\nin fact , in the area of environmental epigenetics , such agents as well as other endocrine disruptors including organochlorines , are likely to play a pivotal role .\nthis could be an important link with cancers arising from hormone - responsive tissues , including the breast and prostate .\ndisruptors of hormonal status via epimutagenic processes are yet to be understood in terms of their long - term health consequences .\nthe interplay between genotoxicity and epigenetic alterations remains to be elucidated ; for instance , acetylation of histones occurs during the process of dna damage induction . as direct - acting dna - damaging agents are traditionally known as genotoxins , agents that induce aberrant epigenetic alterations may be known as epimutagens . in general ,\ncancer is typified by global genomic hypomethylation and site - specific hypermethylation , especially at tsgs : the former being associated with an overactive genome and proliferation , and the latter with inactivation of genes such as tp53 that might sit at the crossroads between induction of aberrant proliferation and apoptosis .\ntime of exposure during life , dose , gender , and organ specificity all need to be considered in the development of epigenetic endpoints as biomarkers for exposure to epimutagenic toxicants .\nhow at different stages of life in a particular target organ there is induction of irreversible changes to the genetic material ( i.e. , dna mutations ) against a backdrop of putatively reversible changes to the epigenetic landscape ( i.e. , changes in the dna methylation and chromatin modification state ) remains to be understood .\ndoes the latter modify accessibility of the genome in a fashion that predisposes it to genotoxic insult ?\nthis may underpin the interplay between genotoxic and epigenetic mechanisms in the aetiology of cancer .\nlinking exposures and their possible effects to environmental health is a major inter - disciplinary challenge .\ninter - individual variability increases with age and is probably mediated by an environmental modification of the epigenome ; this could explain why genetically identical twins might age differently .\nin fact , the ageing process has recently been observed to be associated with an increasing level of global genomic hypomethylation . in lung cancer tissues , several gene loci\nideally , epidemiological studies require early biomarkers of risk so that susceptible individuals and/or populations can be identified . in theory , this would facilitate intervention studies within which damaging exposures would be reduced or removed . because epigenetic alterations are modifiable\n, this has enormous implications for cancer prevention and treatment .   in an era of epidemiology that has been largely based on attempting to correlate gene - environment interactions to identify environmental causative factors imposed on a profile of genetic susceptibility , determining parental or ancestral lifestyle and/or environmental influences on transgenerational susceptibility to chronic diseases such as\npopulations that migrate from regions of low disease incidence to high - risk areas do not just face changes in environment ( which may in fact become more contaminant - free and regulated in the case of westernized regions ) , but primarily , and especially in subsequent generations , profound cultural and lifestyle changes .\nthis has resulted amongst asians migrating to the uk in a higher prevalence of type ii diabetes compared to the multigenerational resident population , obesity and coronary heart disease . within a laboratory model such as the agouti mouse\nhowever , given that human lifestyle has changed so dramatically in the last few generations , especially in northern / western europe and usa , factors that were either potentially deleterious ( e.g. , smoking ) or even beneficial ( e.g. , high calorie storage ; ) may manifest an increased susceptibility or protection in a subsequent generation . understanding ancestral influences on current risk stratification in today 's global population is going to be a major challenge in coming years . the traditional model of cancer causation\nis based on an initiating exposure ( independent of age ) by a genotoxic / mutagenic agent followed by a multistage process of promotion , which may take > 20  yrs in humans [ 87 , 88 ] ; invasive disease characterized by gross genomic instability then progresses beyond this . in the absence of the inheritance of highly - penetrant mutant alleles ( e.g. , brca1/2 )\n, this model has laid the basis for our understanding of the aetiology of sporadic cancers .\nthe need for an initiating exposure was first proposed by roger case in his studies of bladder cancer incidence in dye industry workers [ 89 , 90 ] , and subsequent studies of the role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer [ 91 , 92 ] have been pivotal in the acceptance of this theory . molecular archaeology studies clearly demonstrate that a specific environmental / dietary chemical exposure ( e.g. , aflatoxin b1 ) can induce a particular mutation in localized  hotspots  of critical genes ( e.g. , the tumour suppressor tp53 ) in hepatocellular carcinoma [ 93 , 94 ]\n.   one can now point to several types and classes of physical and chemical environmental and dietary carcinogens , which will with or without a bioactivation step ( the latter required in the case of inert chemicals ) induce a genotoxic event , ultimately giving rise to mutations in target cells .\nthese include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) such as b[a]p , heterocyclic aromatic amines ( haas ) such as 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [ 4,5-b]pyridine ( phip ) , physical agents such as ultraviolet ( uv ) or ionizing radiation , and materials including asbestos fibres [ 98 , 99 ] . with indirect or inert chemical carcinogens , a bioactivation step is required ( mediated primarily by cytochrome p450 mixed function oxidases ( cyps ) , but also by n - acetyltransferases ( nats ) or sulfotransferases ) to generate electrophilic intermediates that then give rise to covalent dna adducts at nucleophilic sites on dna bases , for example , c8 position of deoxyguanosine [ 100 , 101 ] .\nthe generation of base substitution or frameshift mutations then occurs via the inaccurate repair of the adducted template , which has been associated with the replication complex performing a mutagenic bypass of the lesion by a slippage mechanism [ 102 , 103 ] .\nthe question is how does the epigen determine the magnitude of the mutagen or genotoxin effect ?\nchromatin accessibility plays a role in not only regulating cell - type specific gene expression , but also dna repair ; if epigenetic mechanisms determine the accessibility of pivotal genes to electrophilic attack giving rise to dna adducts and to subsequent faulty repair mechanisms , this might be a plausible link between the genotoxic insult and the epigenomic modification governing individual susceptibility to cancer causation .\n, the offspring does not have an inherently susceptible genome in terms of polymorphic differences in a panel of susceptibility genes ( e.g. , bioactivating , dna repair , or detoxification ) , but the structural dimensions of the chromatin facilitate its vulnerability to exogenously- and/or endogenously - derived insults .\nthus the parental or ancestral environment and/or lifestyle generated the evolution of a genomic sos , that is heritable , and predetermines from early life the offspring 's susceptibility to genotoxic carcinogens . within the accessible genome ,\nthere is a greatly elevated chance of the initiation - promotion multistage process of carcinogenesis occurring . before embarking on an epidemiological study ,\nsample size calculations are important to provide evidence that the proposed study is capable of detecting real associations between study factors .\ntraditionally , to know what size of relative risk may be confidently detected with the projected size of the cohort and length of followup , one often determines the adequacy of cohort size at the planning stage of a study .\ndisease epidemiology aiming at identification of carcinogens and quantification of associated risks has always had an apparent low resolving power , with detectable incidence or mortality increments often being orders of magnitude smaller than levels which would be of public concern .\nother drawbacks of disease epidemiology are the long latency times in development of chronic diseases , difficulties in reliably tracking large population cohorts and the influence of confounders .\nbiomarkers such as gene polymorphisms or chemical - dna adducts were through the 1990 's employed as measures to improve cause specificity [ 108110 ] . in the main ,\nthese have proved limited in their ability to generate robust risk associations . with the increasing development of systems\nbiology approaches that generate large and complex datasets , deriving significant associations with chronic conditions such as cancer will become more challenging .\nfor instance , in genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) that aim to identify genetic variants related to diseases by examining the associations between phenotypes and hundreds of thousands of geno - typed markers , new theoretical frameworks are required .  \nchemical - dna adducts do occur in target tissues such as the prostate , although their levels may not correlate with expression levels of bioactivating enzymes .\nto estimate sample size using a simple cause - and - effect model is difficult .\nthe majority of studies have failed to provide robust associations with common complex diseases ; that said increasing sample size dramatically may be capable of achieving this , and these observations have given stimulus to the implementation of biobank studies worldwide .\nhowever , incorporation of a transgenerational component into epidemiology studies could require the incorporation of an uncertainty factor in their design .\nthis could also explain why exceedingly large studies are required to robustly isolate cause and effect against the major confounder of inherited chromatin organization determined by ancestral , environmental , and/or lifestyle factors .\nthe complex interplay between nature ( could be understood as genotype ) and nurture ( understood as lifestyle and/or environment ) has been considered to hamper efforts to specify quantitatively the relative contribution of either to disease causation .\nquestions traditionally addressed would be whether particular polymorphisms in key genes ( e.g. , nat2 ) could be associated with a disease endpoint ( e.g. , bladder cancer ) in chinese subjects exposed to an agent ( e.g. , benzidine ) ; here , there appears to be a protective effect of the slow acetylator genotype .\nalthough individual combinations of polymorphic traits may modify susceptibility to exposures , in the complex disease scenario many studies have failed to show robust risk associations with genotype [ 118120 ] .\nspontaneous deamination of 5-mec to thymidine ( which is not excised or repaired ) could be a significant source of signature mutations   in particular cancers .\nthese ct transitions at cpg sites appear to be prevalent mutations in tp53 in human colon cancer . in the context of this hypothesis\n, the question might be whether the definition of an epimutagen could be expanded not just to include altering the methylome , histone code , or profile of noncoding rnas , but also the altering of the accessibility of important regions of the chromatin to genotoxic insult .   as lifetime exposures to environmental carcinogens\nmight be expected to increase risk , especially in genotypes perceived as vulnerable , for example , glutathione - s - transferase null , other lifestyle factors such as consumption of fruit and vegetables appear to be protective against risk of disease [ 124 , 125 ] and even initial dna damage .\nhowever , with the emergence of the epigenomics field the role of modifiable factors takes on another dimension .\none could surmise under the model hypothesized here that environmental and/or lifestyle factors typically associated with a western region might induce the evolution of a genomic sos .\nhowever , are there risk factors such as tobacco smoke or infection that potentiate or accelerate this and thus greatly increase the accessibility of chromatin in future generations to genotoxic insult ?\nconversely , are there protective factors such as healthy intakes of fresh fruit and vegetables that counteract these effects and retard the evolution of the genomic sos ? within epidemiology , deciphering the role of transgenerational influences mediated by epigenetic marking of the chromatin may require a detailed human epigenome project [ 127129 ] . this could allow a stratification of predisposing early - life risk based on the structural organization of the inherited genome and the expression pattern therein . given the even more individualized nature of the epigenome compared to the genome ( it being the genome modified by environment )\nwithin this context it will be interesting to determine whether the epigenome of an individual is relatively similar across all tissues or whether there are between - organ and within - organ differences in the epigenomic profile . for years\nthere has been evidence of a field effect in cancer in which the surrounding tissue might provide the microenvironment allowing the cancerous growth .\nthis has been associated with nuclear changes ( possibly epigenetic ) and downstream epigenetic - associated events including changes in gene and protein expression , dna damage , and angiogenesis .\nthus in prostate , the androgen receptor promotes growth of cancer initiating cells via autonomous signalling pathways , whereas there is a lack and no apparent need for androgen receptor signalling in surrounding stroma . the question would be whether there are differing epigenomic profiles even within the same tissue , some which may generate a field change necessary to nurture the promotion and progression of disease , and others necessary for the clonal expansion of an initiated cell(s ) .\nadditionally , there is emerging interest in exosomes , which are extracellular subnanosized vesicles that are believed to contain defined patterns of mrna , mirna , noncoding rna , and occasionally genomic dna .\nthis may be a relatively unexplored mechanism of intercellular communication in which transferred genetic information may induce transient or persistent phenotypic changes in recipient cells .\nexosomes play a fundamental biological role in the regulation of normal physiological as well as aberrant pathological processes , via altered gene regulatory networks and/or via epigenetic programming ; how they may modulate the microenvironmental epigenome remains to be ascertained . in the past ,\ncorrelations of environmental exposure and cytogenetic biomarkers have been very complex   because of the interaction of independent factors ( e.g. , genotype versus exposure ) . often within each factor\n, there will be a requirement to stratify for variables such as age or gender .\nhow such a variable could be readily factored into large - scale epidemiological studies is uncertain . in general\none relies on biological material that is readily available , including blood ( whole serum or plasma ) , buccal mucosa , or urine .\ncirculating free dna in plasma has often been used . whether epigenetic alterations in surrogate tissues such as peripheral blood lymphocytes correlate with exposures ( ancestral versus present ) and can reflect disease risk or development in a target tissue remains to be determined . as more regions\nbecome increasingly westernized in their lifestyle , based on the genomic sos model , one could surmise that the environmental and/or dietary influences are already occurring in the present generation in traditionally low - risk regions of china , india , or japan ; this will predispose the next generations to higher incidences of breast and prostate cancer .\nfigure 1(a ) shows that incidence of colorectal cancer in japan is now not dissimilar to levels observed in northern / western europe or the usa , the former being traditionally a low - risk region for this disease .\nhowever , levels of breast or prostate cancer still remain relatively low in this region ; that said , are epigenetic modifications already occurring that in the next decades will predispose this population to markedly higher levels of this disease ?\nthis transgenerational switch in chromatin accessibility could be a dichotomous marker to the offspring 's commitment to an elevated risk .\nthe development of robust and high - throughput sensor platforms examining the in situ methylation status or genomic sos may be far off .\ndespite an overwhelming amount of epidemiological evidence pointing to a role for environment and/or lifestyle in the aetiology of breast and prostate cancer , the failure to identify causative factors has led some to question this in favour of endogenous entities , for example , reactive oxygen species and hormones .\nhowever , how ancestral exposures may influence the accessibility and consequent susceptibility of an individual 's genome remains to be understood .\nthis transgenerational influence may not be applicable in all cancers ( e.g. , lung , colorectal , or stomach ) in which there might be more direct applications of the causative agent(s ) ( e.g. , tobacco smoke constituents , haas , or nitrosamines ) to the target site .\nas a consequence , such cancers exhibit a faster rate of increasing or decreasing incidence in migrant populations from low-/high - risk regions .   the additional generation gap between migration from a low - risk region and attaining an incidence of breast or prostate cancer similar to the host populations points to a transgenerational step .\nthe hypothesis laid out herein is that in the f0/f1 generations there occurs an evolution towards a genomic sos , a model within which the chromatin becomes more accessible for genotoxic insult ( figure 2 ) .\nthis organizational structure of the chromatin is inherited and could be considered an epimutagenic event lending increased susceptibility to the organism and preceding mutagenic events incurred via environment and/or lifestyle factors by the f2/f3 generations .\nsuch a model could partially explain why traditional epidemiological studies have in the main failed to draw firm cause - and - effect conclusions .\na combination of novel sensor technologies and epigenetic biomarkers will be needed to order to integrate ancestral epigenetic influences at the organism , organ , and within - organ levels into future studies designed to give insights into the aetiology of these cancers .\nif ancestral influences such as environment and/or lifestyle markedly influence susceptibility to chronic diseases such as sporadic breast or prostate cancer , this will have enormous social as well as biological implications ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " epidemiological studies have consistently supported the notion that environmental and/or dietary factors play a central role in the aetiology of cancers of the breast and prostate . however , for more than five decades investigators have failed to identify a single cause - and - effect factor , which could be implicated ; identification of a causative entity would allow the implementation of an intervention strategy in at - risk populations . \n this suggests a more complex pathoaetiology for these cancer sites , compared to others . when one examines the increases or decreases in incidence of specific cancers amongst migrant populations , it is notable that disease arising in colon or stomach requires one or at most two generations to exhibit a change in incidence to match that of high - incidence regions , whereas for breast or prostate cancer , at least three generations are required . \n this generational threshold could suggest a requirement for nonmutation - driven epigenetic alterations in the f0/f1 generations ( parental / offspring adopting a more westernized lifestyle ) , which then predisposes the inherited genome of subsequent generations to mutagenic / genotoxic alterations leading to the development of sporadic cancer in these target sites . \n as such , individual susceptibility to carcinogen insult would not be based per se on polymorphisms in activating / detoxifying / repair enzymes , but on elevated accessibility of crucial target genes ( e.g. , oncogenes , tumour suppressor genes ) or hotspots therein to mutation events . this could be termed a genomic susceptibility organizational structure ( sos ) . \n several exposures including alcohol and heavy metals are epigens ( i.e. , modifiers of the epigenome ) , whereas others are mutagenic / genotoxic , for example , heterocyclic aromatic amines ; humans are continuously and variously exposed to mixtures of these agents . \n within such a transgenerational multistage model of cancer development , determining the interaction between epigenetic modification to generate a genomic sos and genotoxic insult will facilitate a new level of understanding in the aetiology of cancer .

considering the age range of our sample ( 1336  years ) , this result was similar to ours . a number of crosssectional studies have demonstrated that imt increases with advancing age,21 , 24 which is consistent with our results even after adjustment for the other cv risk factors over time .\nas in the young finn study , sex differences in the imt were mostly explained by differences in risk factors and vessel size.21 in line with previous findings imt increased with increasing bmi,25 and childhood ses played a significant role early in the atherosclerotic disease process.26 , 27 , 28 \n  contrary to numerous previous studies we did not find an association between imt and exercise , smoking , and alcohol drinking.29 , 30 , 31 , 32 consistent with our result , the association between smoking status and imt has been reported by sass and colleagues in middleaged but not in young adults.8 the short smoking duration in the younger population may be 1 possible reason to explain this paradox .\nseveral studies have reported an association between systolic bp and imt in a middleaged population,10 , 33 but some studies in children and young adults have not found such an association.8 , 10 we also did not find an association between blood pressure and imt in the present study .\nthis discrepancy may be due to differences in study protocols ( eg , age range of study cohort and portion of the carotid artery that is studied).8 , 10 , 34 \n  interestingly , we found a faster increase in the mean imt on the left side than that on the right side .\nkollias and colleagues reported that the leftside imt was higher and more closely related to cv risk factors ( mainly systolic bp ) than that on the right side in children.35 several other studies also demonstrated that imt is higher on the left side than the right side in middleaged or older populations.36 , 37 these results were consistent with our study to some extent .\natherosclerotic processes at different artery segments are a result of differing mechanisms associated with the specific structure .\nthe artery segments differ in geometry , cellular composition , and function and are exposed differently to shear stress.38 , 39 hernandez and colleagues found a higher left imt than right imt in untreated hypertensive patients , and this finding has been attributed to the higher crosssectional area of the intimamedia complex and higher flow velocity at the left side.14 our results suggest that changes in the leftside imt might be better indicators of atherosclerotic processes in young adults . whether the observed differences reflect a natural course of adaptive vascular injury on different shear stress conditions requires further study .\nfirst , our cohort just included black and white americans , and the results may not be generalizable to other populations .\nsecond , imt was measured only in the common carotid artery , making it difficult to compare with other studies using different segments of the carotid artery . here\nwe consistently scanned the common carotid artery , and it is possible that including the carotid bifurcation and the internal carotid artery may enhance the prediction of atherosclerotic disease.40 third , we only have 3 visit measurements , and not all participants were measured 3 times in our study ;

aged obese woman presenting with a sella turcica at / rt with suprasellar extension . at / rt is a rare , aggressive , and malignant disease typical of infancy and childhood affecting the central nervous system , first defined as \natypical teratoid tumor.21 based on histological evidence of diffuse proliferation of atypical large cells with eccentrically located nuclei , prominent nucleoli , and abundant cytoplasm ( rhabdoid cells ) , the disease was later referred to as at / rt of the brain in order to emphasize the variable combination of rhabdoid cells , epithelial cells , and primitive neuroectodermal , as well as mesenchymal features,1 its occurrence in adult patients is extremely rare , as 95% of reported patients are 5 years old or younger.8,22 only 32 documented cases have been described in adults to date , usually located in the cerebral hemisphere , cerebellum , and spinal cord , even if unusual locations such as the mediastinum , liver , neck , shoulder , and retroperitoneum have been described.4,23 a unique presentation of a rare case of adolescent at / rt confined to the leptomeninges with no obvious intraparenchymal primary lesion and no focal neurological deficit has been also reported.24 occurrence of at / rt in the sellar region is rare , with only 7 cases reported so far.25,26 the rare incidence of this lesion , in particular in adults , may lead to its misdiagnosis as in the case reported here where the early diagnosis was pituitary macroadenoma with suprasellar extension .\nhowever , our patient s age and the sellar origin of her tumor may argue against a diagnosis of at / rt and dictate a differential diagnosis with pituitary carcinoma or metastasis . the definitive diagnosis might be carried out through loss of immunohistochemical ini1 protein expression due to mutations of the ini1/hsnf5 gene.27,28 the prognosis of at / rt is poor both in adults and in the pediatric population , although long - term survival is possible in adult at / rt cases after a combined approach including surgery , adjuvant radiotherapy , and chemotherapy.25,29 postoperative radiotherapy is crucial in the treatment of at / rt,30,31 and our patient underwent this treatment to have the remaining tissue removed closer to the sinus cavernous not excised by the neurosurgeon .\nthis combined approach , performed before the final pathological diagnosis , allowed us to observe a better prognosis in the patient with a survival of 30 months . in conclusion , at / rt should be considered in the differential diagnosis of aggressive tumors with sella turcica localization even in middle -

response model ) for evaluating risks to the human genome , led to the adoption of the lnt model for cancer risk assessment .\nit states that the probability of the number of cancer deaths is proportional to the collective radiation dose of a population ( clarke and valentin 2005 ) . for the lung tumor data ( spontaneously - occurring plus radiation - induced ) in fig .\n4 of fisher and weller ( 2010 ) , the lnt model would predict about 5 tumors in the 26 dogs that were exposed to a cumulative alpha - radiation dose in the range 8 to 48 cgy .\nthe observed incidence of 0 tumors in the 16 dogs in the 8 to 22 cgy range and 1 tumor in the 10 dogs in the 27 to 48 cgy range suggests a beneficial effect , but the lnt statistical variations of these low tumor observations are too large to challenge the lnt prediction of 5 tumors .\nhowever , the overall shape of the dose - response data shown in figures fig . 1 to fig .\nfurthermore , severe molecular damage , including many double - strand dna breaks , occurs locally around each plutonium particle in tissue .\nthese breaks are caused by the alpha radiation with its dense ionization , i.e. , high let , over a distance of several cell diameters . since cancer is associated with dna mutations , tumors are predicted at these locations .\nconsidering the spontaneously - occurring lung tumors , it is quite surprising that only one tumor was observed among the 26 dogs that were exposed to cumulative lung absorbed doses in the range 8 to 48 cgy . at these doses\nall cells are hit at least once by an alpha - particle ( simmons and richards 2010 ) .\nthe data and the biology conform to the lack of increased lung cancer in people living in houses with elevated radon concentration ( hall and giaccia 2005 ) and contradict the lnt prediction that the probability of radiation - induced cancer is proportional to dose .\nthere is a large amount of data from a wide variety of medical treatments with radiation at doses below 100 cgy , including treatments for serious infections , and many radiobiological studies , all carried out over the past 120 years .\neven lower doses or lower level dose - rates , predominantly below 20 cgy , can up - regulate adaptive protection systems in terms of delayed and temporary detoxification , dna - repair , and damage removal in various ways ( cuttler 2013 , 2014 ) .\nsuch exposures have been shown to remove spontaneously - occurring cancer cells induced by endogenous effects and also remove radiation - induced damage .\nfor example , oncologist k. sakamoto observed the total removal of tumors in all regions of the body , probably by induction of protective mechanisms , of a patient with advanced ovarian cancer , after treatment with 15 whole - body doses of only 10 cgy x - rays , over a 5 week period ( sakamoto 2004 ) .\nthe biological phenomenon that results from adaptive protection is radiation hormesis ( feinendegen et al .\nthis model predicts a reduction in the overall incidence of lung tumors , as a consequence of stimulation of protection by low level radiation .\nthe fisher and weller ( 2010 ) data comply with these expectations . in the lowest range , from 8 to 22 cgy , no tumors were observed .\n3 indicates a strong rise in the incidence of tumors , as the cumulative dose increases , which flattens starting at about 500 cgy .\nas shown in fig.4 , the noael ( no observed adverse effects level ) is about 100 cgy .\n( radiation pneumonitis is the cause of death following exposures above 3000 cgy . ) in challenging the lnt theory , fisher and weller ( 2010 ) also point to the measured lifespan dose - response relationship in fig . 5 for dogs that inhaled puo2 .\nthe lifespan appears to increase significantly from about 5000 to 6000 days , when the dose rate is raised by a factor of 3.6 from 0.0055 to 0.020 cgy per day .\nthe threshold ( noael ) for a return to 5000 days is ~0.030 cgy per day or 11 cgy per year ( 155 cgy lifetime ) . the data in fig . 4 and 5 point to a beneficial effect after a low dose and\ncontradict the lnt prediction of an excess risk of late health effects in proportion to the radiation dose .\nradiation hormesis theory ( feinendegen et al . 2013 ) is based on the following biological facts : the dna molecules in all organisms are being damaged at a relatively high rate by endogenous processes , which include temperature , reactive oxygen species and other agents .\ndamage to dna , cells and tissues / organs also occurs due to external causes , such as thermal burns , physical injuries , infectious pathogens , ingestion of chemical substances , etc .\nthe rate of damage to dna due to average background radiation , including double strand breaks , is relatively negligible even if the quality of radiogenic dna damage is on average more severe than endogenous dna damage ( pollycove and feinendegen 2003 ) .biological organisms have very powerful protection systems that prevent , repair and remove dna damage , replace damaged cells and tissues , cure infections and endeavour to restore health .\nthe overall ability of these systems to enable individuals to survive even severe stresses and the many daunting challenges of life is very impressive .\nthere are immediately - acting protection systems and adaptive systems responding to internal signals under genetic control ( more than 150 genes involved ) with a delay of up to hours and lasting from days to months and even years .\nthese responses depend on the sensitivity of the affected system with various thresholds . with increasing impact of stressors ,\nthe eventually resulting damage , such as obvious cancer , is then the difference between prevention of damage from different sources by adaptive protection , induced by low dose radiation , and damage caused by the primary radiation impact . \n \nthe dna molecules in all organisms are being damaged at a relatively high rate by endogenous processes , which include temperature , reactive oxygen species and other agents .\ndamage to dna , cells and tissues / organs also occurs due to external causes , such as thermal burns , physical injuries , infectious pathogens , ingestion of chemical substances , etc .\nthe rate of damage to dna due to average background radiation , including double strand breaks , is relatively negligible even if the quality of radiogenic dna damage is on average more severe than endogenous dna damage ( pollycove and feinendegen 2003 ) .\nbiological organisms have very powerful protection systems that prevent , repair and remove dna damage , replace damaged cells and tissues , cure infections and endeavour to restore health .\nthe overall ability of these systems to enable individuals to survive even severe stresses and the many daunting challenges of life is very impressive .\nthere are immediately -

toxicity of inhaled puo2 , plotting the incidence of lung tumors at low doses and observing an apparent threshold at approximately 100 cgy , which is consistent with the data of fisher and weller ( 2010 ) . after assessing strong evidence on the basis of microdosimetric analysis and results of other studies\n, they concluded that there is no reduction in lifespan at lung doses below about 100 cgy and no significant increase in incidence of lung tumors at lung doses below 62 cgy .\nall of the studies  show that there is a threshold in the region of about 100 cgy in the lung dose required to induce cancer in that organ  ( simmons and richards 2012 ) .\n( 2008 ) was designed to measure the lifespan health effects of different degrees of alpha -

quality fruit . a promising strategy for reducing diseases\nplant defence mechanisms are represented by a number of structural and biochemical changes such as phytoalexin synthesis , callose deposition , cell wall lignification , and pathogenesis - related ( pr ) proteins induction .\nhowever , these reactions do not always correlate with disease prevention . among others , salicylic acid ( sa )\nalthough the mechanism of sa - mediated plant defence is not completely understood in all crops , its central role in plant defence is well established [ 68 ] .\naccumulation of sa has been shown to be crucial for the expression of pr proteins   which have antimicrobial activity and thought to be involved in plant resistance . among them , peroxidases were described in plant defence against both necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogens .\nperoxidases can generate a physical barrier to prevent the penetration of the pathogen into the host tissues ; it catalyzes the h2o2-dependent crosslinking of cell wall components leading to cell wall lignification . in the date\npalm - foa pathosystem , the first report confirming the involvement of sa in plant defence was by dihazi et al . , who showed that application of sa activated the metabolism of phenolic compounds and induced the biosynthesis of some hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives then described as sinapic acid derivatives .\nflavonoids are also detected in plant cell walls in interactions with a resistance outcome , and their concentration increased significantly in clover roots in response to infection with pythium ultimum . in the date\npalm -

treated and in sa - treated and inoculated ones .\ninterestingly , two additional isozymes with mm values of 32 and 28  kd were expressed only in sa - treated and inoculated plants and suggested that the activation of peroxidase with sa was more pronounced in infected plants .  \npalm root controls treated with the neu 's reagent , a greenish yellow fluorescence was observed under blue light in sclerenchyma , endodermis , and vascular parenchyma cell walls .\nwhen plants were inoculated with foa , a decrease in this specific fluorescence was observed and a brownish color appeared in cells located near the xylem vessels ( figure 5(b ) ) . when plants were treated with sa and challenged by foa ,\nflavonoids were induced ( 75% ) ( bright orange fluorescence ) in the vascular - parenchyma cell walls near the xylem vessels ( figure 5(d ) ) , probably at sites of potential pathogen penetration . their presence\nclose examination of infected roots ' ultrastructure showed that pathogen ingress toward the vascular stele coincided with extensive vascular disorganization and marked cell alterations of the cytoplasm which was frequently reduced to vesicular remnants ( figure 6(d ) ) .\nthe colonization was characterized by a marked deterioration of the cell walls resulting in its complete dissolution ( figure 6(c ) ) as compared to the preserved cell walls in uninoculated roots ( figure 6(a ) ) . in all cases ,\nthe observed pattern of fungal colonization and host cell disorganization coincided with the occurrence of macroscopically visible symptoms along the roots , leading to severe plant wilting and eventually plant death .\nfungal growth was mainly intracellular , but it could also occur intercellularly through direct host wall penetration . the germ - tube attempts to cross the host cell walls occurred preferably through the plasmodesmata at pit fields lacking secondary wall material ( figures 6(b ) and 6(h ) ) .\nin sa - treated plants , the colonization by foa differed markedly from that observed in control plants .\nfungal growth was reduced , and hyphae were seldom seen in the tissues of the host roots .\none of the most striking changes observed in sa - treated plants as compared with controls was the elaboration of several host defence reactions that included the deposition of an electron - dense material closely associated with the cell walls ( figure 6(f ) ) .\nthis material forms a coat in the vessel lumen ( figure 6(g ) ) and at sites of intercellular spaces leading to plug them ( figure 6(e ) ) and eventually to alter the invading hyphae ( figure 6(h ) ) .\nwall appositions were also observed at sites of pathogen invasion ( figure 6(f ) ) .\nthese structures were associated with fungal cell walls ' distortion , breakdown of the plasma membrane , and an apparent densification of the cytoplasm ( figure 6(h ) ) .\nthey are probably meant to strengthen the host cell walls and to prevent the pathogen from spreading .\nwe have previously described the role of sa in enhancing the survival of foa - infected date palm plants by triggering the synthesis of new phenolic compounds   which were identified as hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives [ 13 , 25 ] .\ntreatment to our knowledge , this is the first report showing the effects of sa on the cytochemical changes of the root tissues in the date palm - foa interaction .\nthese results suggest that sa induced protein synthesis in both inoculated and uninoculated plants , especially in the cell layer surrounding the xylem vessels and also in vascular parenchyma cells located near the endodermis and in some cortical parenchyma cell walls .\nthe proteins induced in response to sa treatment were strongly expressed in asymptomatic date palm plants and could play a role in resistance . in nontreated inoculated plants ,\nthese proteins were present , but not enough to stop the spreading of the pathogen and several signs of tissue alterations were noted . in agreement with earlier studies\n, the present results confirmed that defence reactions in sa - treated plants were more pronounced after fungal challenge .\nmoreover , we have shown that both sa - treated plants and the infected ones have expressed high peroxidase activity , with two isozymes ( 150 and 142  kd ) in inoculated plants that disappear in sa - treated ones and two new isozymes ( 32 and 28  kd ) expressed only in sa - treated and inoculated plants .\nthe expression of these new isozymes only in inoculated and sa - treated plants may constitute a sort of  priming  of date palm plants toward its pathogen .\nthis corroborates other findings that correlated date palm resistance against foa with peroxidase activity [ 2628 ] . indeed ,\njaiti et al .   had shown that jasmonic acid increased the peroxidase activity in date palm plants after foa infection .\nperoxidases are frequently responsive to sa or jasmonic acid , and it is widely known that they play a central role in host plant defences against pathogens .\nperoxidases may be involved in the peroxidation of substrate molecules , leading to the accumulation of highly toxic compounds , which may contribute to resistance via their antifungal potential .\ninterestingly , a high peroxidase activity was detected in the phenolic - storing cells , especially in sa - treated date palm roots .\nfurthermore , salicylic acid is known to repress some jasmonic acid pathway - related defence mechanisms [ 31 , 32 ] .\nthis may explain the presence of isozymes in inoculated plants then their absence after sa treatment .\nwhy some isoforms of peroxidase are induced while others are repressed remains to be determined .\nin addition , histochemical analysis showed that flavonoids accumulated only in sa - treated and foa - inoculated plants and filled the vascular parenchyma cell walls .\nthis confirms the implication of sa in sensitizing date palm plants to respond faster to its pathogen .\nthese phenolics are different from those revealed in date palm root controls which were caffeic acid derivatives .\nflavonoids were considered as important phenolic compounds detected in plant cell walls in resistant interactions .\ntheir accumulation has occurred only in the resistant cotton variety inoculated with the pathogen xanthomonas axonopodis pv .\nmore recently , carlsen et al .   have shown that the concentrations of flavonoids formononetin and daidzein increased significantly in clover roots in response to infection with pythium ultimum .\ndixon   confirmed the antimicrobial action of flavonoids during plant - fungal pathogen defence responses .\nmcnally et al . , using the podosphaera xanthii - cucumber interaction , have also localized the production of c - glycosyl flavonoids in resistant plants .\nmore recently , el hadrami et al .   have shown the involvement of rutin in the interaction between potato and verticillium dahliae . in the date\npalm - foa pathosystem , flavonoids have been detected in trace amounts in date palm roots   and have been suggested to play a role in date palm callus defence against foa , but none of the previously published studies has reported the involvement of sa in triggering the accumulation of flavonoids related to date palm plant defence .\nour data suggest that flavonoids were expressed after sa treatment in the cell walls of vascular parenchyma cells closely associated with the xylem vessels especially in tissues around the necrotic zone and this is associated with plant resistance .\nhave reported that the necrosis formations may come from the action of peroxidase on flavonoids during the lignification process . to investigate whether the observed biochemical changes correlate with the structural modifications ,\ndate palm root tissues were examined at the ultrastructural level . in nontreated date palm plants ,\npathogen ingress into the vascular stele was characterized by severe host cell alterations , including cell wall degradation and alteration of the cytoplasm , which was frequently reduced to vesicular remnants .\nthis may suggest that the fungus produces cell wall hydrolytic enzymes that hydrolyze host components and lead to fungal spread into the root tissues .\nsuch enzymes were previously described in date palm - foa interaction and were correlated to disease development .\nthe protection against foa in sa - treated date palm plants was associated with a deposition of an electron - dense material , a wall apposition in host cells , and an increase in damaged fungal cells .\nthis electron - dense material was closely associated with intercellular spaces , known to be strategic sites for pathogen spread .\nsuch host reactions , obviously designed to halt pathogen ingress , were never seen in control plants .\nfungal cells , near these electron - dense materials , were frequently disorganized , suggesting a fungitoxic environment generated by this material .\nthe nature of this material is not yet determined . its reactivity to osmium tetraoxide indicates that these compounds are possibly of phenolic nature .\nthe accumulation of phenolic compounds in the host cell walls may contribute to enhancing the mechanical strength of these defensive barriers . according to our cytochemical observations ,\nthe electron - dense material formed in sa - treated root tissues could include flavonoids .\ninterestingly , in banana roots attacked by the nematode radopholus similis , electron - dense materials have been associated with the impregnation of cell walls by flavonoids previously detected by histochemical analysis .\nthe nature of the wall apposition formed after sa treatment is also not yet determined , but their involvement in pathogen attack was demonstrated since fungal cells near these wall appositions were altered .\nseveral reports indicated that wall appositions contain callose and cellulose , as revealed by cytochemical analysis .\nthey provide evidence that sa treatment induces structural and biochemical changes in date palm roots in response to fungal infection .\ncortical and vascular - parenchyma cells are the main cells involved in sa - induced response leading to the accumulation of flavonoids and other phenolic compounds , as well as the induction of new isomers of peroxidase .\nthis confirms the possible implication of sa in triggering date palm defence against its pathogen and confers a promising strategy for effective control of the bayoud disease ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " histochemical and ultrastructural analyses were carried out to assess structural and biochemical changes in date palm roots pretreated with salicylic acid ( sa ) then inoculated with fusarium oxysporum f. sp . \n albedinis ( foa ) . \n flavonoids , induced proteins , and peroxidase activity were revealed in root tissues of sa -

ips , 6% ; p < 0.001 ) .\nmoreover , studies have suggested that hypotension , raynaud 's phenomenon , and migraine are related to primary vascular dysregulation .\nprimary vascular dysregulation has been known to cause unstable ocular perfusion and act as a strong pathogenic mechanism of glaucoma . in this study , reported hypotension , migraine , and raynaud 's phenomenon were found in higher frequency in the ics group than in the ips group ( p < 0.001 , p = 0.003 , p = 0.001 , respectively ) . additionally , snoring is a sign of sleep apnea , which has been reported to be a vascular dysregulatory risk factor for glaucoma .\nthe higher prevalence of glaucoma , especially ntg , in patients with sleep apnea may be due to decreased ocular blood flow during sleep apnea . in this study\n, we found that the reported snoring was significantly more frequent among patients with ics than in patients with ips ( p = 0.001 ) .\nthus , based on the comparison of non - iop - related risk factors , we found that vascular dysregulatory factors were more commonly reported in patients with ics when compared with ips .\nthe previous studies have reported a possible connection between smoking and glaucoma with conflicting results .\nwilson et al . , exploring the relationship between smoking and oag , found a positive association of smoking with oag .\nother studies of similar nature , however , could not find smoking to be associated with oag , nor with increased iops . regarding obesity ,\nobesity seems not to be a risk factor for glaucoma by some , but bmi has been reported to be inversely related to oag by others .\nalso , another study has reported that a patient with higher bmi has a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with glaucoma . in the singapore malay eye study\n, it was reported that higher bmi patients show small cup - disc ratios , and this suggests a protective effect of high bmi on oag .\nhowever , it is still unclear whether obesity may increase or decrease the likelihood of glaucoma .\ntherefore , this study was designed to determine whether lifestyle related risk factors , such as smoking or obesity , were associated with ics in ntg patients . however\n, our results did not reveal a clear relationship among smoking , obesity and characteristics of vfds .\nalthough these findings coincided with those of previous studies , our results are based on a relatively small sampling of ntg patients and the results can not be considered conclusive . in this study ,\nthis suggests that central field defects are of a more localized nature when compared with peripheral field defects .\nrecently , cho et al .   demonstrated that there are no differences in the clinical characteristics between ics and ips groups , except for the initial vf index and occurrence of superior hemifield ; prevalence of dh , hypotension , migraine , and raynaud 's phenomenon are not significantly different between the two groups .\nthese discrepancies seem to arise from the different characteristics of the two study groups , which are the follow - up period and the number of patients .\nthe follow - up period of the study was more than 7 years , but that of the present study was about 2 years , which is a relatively short period compared with the previous study .\nmoreover , the total number of patients in the study was 66 and the total in this study was 159 . an additional long - term follow - up study is needed to compare the results .\nthis study has some shortcomings due to the retrospective nature of its design and the relatively small number of patients .\nalso , data regarding the prevalence of systemic risk factors were collected from the questionnaire survey , which is subject to error , ignorance and recall bias .\nfuture large - scale prospective case - control studies are needed to validate the results of this study . in conclusion , this study found that ntg patients with ics had a distinctive set of vascular risk factors , such as reported systemic hypotension , migraine , raynaud 's phenomenon , and self - reported snoring when compared to the patients with ips .\nawareness of the relationship between vascular risk factors and ics may be useful in managing patients with ntg .\nbecause patients with ics may be at a greater risk of losing sight , ntg patients with systemic vascular factors or dh should be followed more carefully .\nfurther study is needed to elucidate the relationship between the non - iop vascular pathogenesis and initial vf characteristics ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " purposeto investigate the risk factors for initial central scotoma ( ics ) compared with initial peripheral scotoma ( ips ) in normal - tension glaucoma ( ntg).methodsfifty - six ntg patients ( 56 eyes ) with an ics and 103 ntg patients ( 103 eyes ) with an ips were included . retrospectively \n , the differences were assessed between the two groups for baseline characteristics , ocular factors , systemic factors , and lifestyle factors . \n also , the mean deviation of visual field was compared between the two groups.resultspatients from both ics and ips groups were of similar age , gender , family history of glaucoma , and follow - up periods . \n frequency of disc hemorrhage was significantly higher among patients with ics than in patients with ips . \n moreover , systemic risk factors such as hypotension , migraine , raynaud 's phenomenon , and snoring were more prevalent in the ics group than in the ips group . there were no statistical differences in lifestyle risk factors such as smoking or body mass index . \n pattern standard deviation was significantly greater in the ics group than in the ips group , but the mean deviation was similar between the two groups.conclusionsntg patients with ics and ips have different profiles of risk factors and clinical characteristics . \n this suggests that the pattern of initial visual field loss may be useful to identify patients at higher risk of central field loss .

skeletal problems were affected by bad \n ergonomics and excess weight11 .\nthere are \n other studies in the literature that show a relation between obesity and low back pain14 , 15 . similar to these studies , this study , too , showed a correlation \n between lack of a lumbar support , smoking and age factors .\nhowever , in contrast to the \n literature , weight was not a factor influencing low back pain . since this was a study that \n included young adults , subjects with normal weights were the majority .\nhowever , in elderly subjects it may be a variable that affects low \n back pain .\nin the literature , there are studies which were conducted of university students from \n different departments which investigated low back pain according to department .\nthis study \n also investigated students from different departments , as well as students of different \n classes .\nhowever , the prevalence of low back pain was 53.4% in medicine students , whereas \n it was 60.7% in sports students16 . in the \n study of falavigna\n, a clear relationship was found \n between physiotherapy bachelor s level education and lbp17 .\nthey stated that the long periods of studying hours had an \n important effect on the onset of lbp . in another study of dentistry students\n, it was \n determined that the onset of lumbar , cervical and shoulder pain was seen when the students \n started their clinical practice training18 .\nit was previously reported that students of medical departments \n are at higher risk of low back pain than students of other departments . although there are \n conflicting results in the literature , the present study did not find a difference between \n the students of physiotherapy and nursing and other departments , with regard to low back \n pain , and showed that the educational department was not a variable explaining low back \n pain .\nhowever , the  class  variable was a factor influencing low back pain , and it increased \n with the increase in classes .\nthe reason may be students undervaluing ergonomics . because \n it was determined that the upper classes commonly had practical lessons , whereas the lower \n classes commonly had theoretical lessons .\nmany previous studies were conducted in order to determine the reason for lbp in students . \n\nhowever , lbp is not dependent on only one reason , it is a multi - factorial disease .\nthus , the \n analysis method should evaluate all the possible factors that may affect the pain .\nthis \n study evaluated many factors that possibly affect low back pain at the same time . the chaid method used in this study\nhowever , chaid makes it \n possible to compare many variables at the same time .\nthus , such methods , which have more \n explanatory power , should be used more frequently , as they strengthen the validity of study \n results .\nuniversity students with low back pain have been grouped as a single category , but \n they include cases with different pathologies and symptoms .\nstudies should be conducted \n following the formation of categories for different pathologies , symptoms and medical \n histories .\nmany factors \n that may cause low back pain were investigated in this study . however , psychological \n factors , other physiological factors such as posture , muscle strength or flexibility should \n also be investigated .\nthus , \n subject characteristics should be included in the analysis in order to shed light in future \n studies .\nage , smoking \n situations , classes , pain durations , sitting upright in front of monitors and disuse lumbar \n support are variables that affect nonspecific low back pain in students .\nin order to reduce \n or prevent nonspecific low back pain , students should be educated in their first classes and \n their smoking habits should be changed ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "   [ purpose ] this study was conducted on university students with nonspecific low back pain \n in order to determine the independent variables that affect their pain . \n [ methods ] a total \n of 514 students were included in this study . \n pain was evaluated using a visual analogue \n scale ( vas ) . \n a special form was prepared in order to evaluate the following independent \n variables : gender , weight , height , body mass index ( bmi ) , working periods sitting straight \n ( television , computer , seminar , etc . ) , working periods bending at a table ( reading , \n writing , etc . ) , using lumbar support while sitting , the mean duration of pain within the \n last one year , type of pain , time of the pain , faculty , class , physical activity habits \n and smoking . \n the collected data were evaluated using the chaid ( chi -

figure 4 ) . moreover\n, the comparison of mean eclam values between anti - dsdna  and anti - dsdna + patients did not show any significant difference ( 0.9  1.05 versus 1.0  0.9 , p = 0.8 ) .\nthis result was confirmed indirectly by the evaluation of treatment in this group of patients : 46.1% of the patients maintained the same treatment regardless of the anti - dsdna modification .\nnonetheless , 17.3% of the population who become anti - dsdna negative required the introduction of a new immunosuppressant treatment .\nthe results of the present study identified an association between the persistent or previous positivity for anti - dsdna and specific clinical ( kidney involvement ) and immunological features ( reduction of c4 serum levels , positivity for anti - rnp antibodies ) .\nconversely , patients negative for anti - dsdna seem to show a clinical picture characterized by a higher prevalence of serositis . moreover\n, the patients experiencing the modification of anti - dsdna status during disease course do not appear to represent a specific subgroup .\nsle is an autoimmune disease , potentially involving any organ / system , with a remitting - relapsing course [ 2 , 16 ] . from a pathogenetic point of view\nanti - dsdna represent the hallmark of sle patients having a diagnostic value given their strong specificity [ 6 , 7 ] .\nmoreover , the presence of anti - dsdna has been associated with a more severe disease pattern characterized by renal involvement , and a titer increase may predict a disease relapse [ 11 , 12 ] . despite these considerations about the role of anti - dsdna\n, a growing interest is devoted to other antibodies detected in the serum of sle patients , as evident by the classification criteria recently proposed by the systemic lupus international collaborating clinics [ 17 , 18 ] .\nindeed , this new classification is characterized by the modification of immunological items : autoantibodies other than anti - dsdna , such as anti - sm , la , anti - cl , and anti-2gpi , have been considered as a single criterion , determining the greater weight of these antibodies in the classification of sle patients . on the other hand ,\ndata from the literature suggest an association between different autoantibodies and specific clinical manifestations such as anti - dsdna and lupus nephritis , anti - ssa / ssb and sicca symptoms , and anti - rnp and raynaud 's phenomenon . to and petri in 2005 identified different autoantibody clusters in a large cohort of sle patients .\nthe authors suggested that the sm / rnp cluster represents the most benign subset , with more frequent skin involvement and less common renal and hematological manifestations .\nconversely , the cluster anti - dsdna / la / anti - cl is characterized by neuropsychiatric manifestations and thrombotic events . in the present cohort ,\nwe registered a frequency of anti - dsdna greater than 70% that is similar to the data reported in the literature for other caucasian sle populations .\nthe persistent or previous positivity status for anti - dsdna seems to identify a sle subset characterized by the positivity for anti - rnp and the reduction of c4 serum levels .\nmoreover , the significantly higher frequency of renal involvement in persistently positive patients is in agreement with data from the epidemiological studies , thus confirming the pathogenetic role of anti - dsdna in the kidney injury [ 9 , 11 , 20 ] .\nfurthermore , the association with low c4 serum levels confirms the link between anti - dsdna and complement in sle patients with renal manifestations .\nrecent evidence suggests the influence of the complement receptors in the development of anti - dsdna by participating in clearance of immune complexes and/or modulating b cells activation in response to antigen .\nthe association with a higher frequency of anti - rnp could be difficult to interpret .\nas known , patients affected by mixed connective tissue disease are frequently positive for these autoantibodies , with a frequency reaching 100% . in sle patients , the presence of anti - rnp ranges from 10 to 30% and is associated with specific manifestations , such as arthritis and raynaud 's phenomenon . moreover , according to data from the abovementioned analysis conducted by to and petri , the sm / rnp cluster seems to be the most benign subset , with less common renal involvement . in our cohort , the presence of joint involvement and raynaud 's phenomenon is similar in the three groups of patients . these results could be explained by the different ethnicity in the cohorts evaluated . in the previous cohort , less than 60% of sle patients evaluated were caucasian ; conversely , almost all sle patients evaluated in the present analysis are caucasian .\nmoreover , we analyzed the group of sle patients persistently negative for anti - dsdna , identifying a significantly higher frequency of serositis compared to the anti - dsdna positive patients .\ndata from the literature describe serositis as a frequent sle manifestation , especially as pericarditis ( 848% of patients ) and pleurisy ( 3045% ) . in our analysis ,\nthe frequency of serositis in persistently anti - dsdna negative patients resulted higher than 80% .\nseveral authors have reported the association between serositis and positivity for anti - ssa / ssb antibodies , unconfirmed in our cohort [ 7 , 24 ] .\ncertainly , a limit to consider is the relatively small number of patients in this group ( 96 subjects ) , determining caution in the interpretation of the results . in the light of the features of this group , a better analysis , by assessing larger population , could be very attractive in order to characterize these sle patients and to modify some aspect strictly related to the positivity for anti - dsdna .\nfor example , biological drugs , such as belimumab , could be prescribed exclusively in patients with positivity for anti - dsdna , considering active disease only in these patients .\nsle is a multifactorial disease in which genetic and environmental factors interplay , determining disease development [ 2 , 25 , 26 ] .\nthe genetic background could explain not only the disease susceptibility but also the autoantibodies production .\nthe genome - wide association study , conducted by chung and colleagues in 2011 , demonstrated that many previously identified sle - associated genes are more strongly associated with the production of anti - dsdna than with disease susceptibility .\nthe authors demonstrated the association between polymorphisms ( snps ) located in the mhc , stat4 , irf5 , and itgam regions and the positivity for anti - dsdna antibodies .\nconversely , only snps in the mhc and irf5 regions have been identified in negative patients .\nfinally , for the first time the present study analyzed a peculiar group of sle patients , those with initial positivity and subsequent negativity of anti - dsdna .\nfirstly , the only clinical and laboratory difference identified in patients who become negative for anti - dsdna compared to persistently positive patients was a lower frequency of renal involvement .\nmoreover , the modification of autoantibodies status was not associated with a change in disease activity , as demonstrated by the absence of significant difference in the mean eclam values before and after the status change .\nwe have chosen to assess disease activity by eclam , because this index does not include the anti - dsdna determination among the items evaluated , unlike other disease activity indices such as sle disease activity ( sledai ) .\nthis observation is reinforced by the evaluation of the therapeutical strategies adopted in this group of patients after the modifications of the anti - dsdna status .\nalmost half of the patients maintained the same treatment and 17.3% required the introduction of a new immunosuppressant drug .\ntaken together these results suggest that the presence of anti - dsdna is associated with a specific subset of disease with peculiar clinical and laboratory features , which do not change when anti - dsdna become negative , maintaining similar aspect also in terms of disease activity . on the contrary\n, the persistently anti - dsdna negative status seems to identify another subset of patients , with peculiar clinical features , in particular serositis ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " \n objectives . \n the anti - dsdna antibodies are a marker for systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) and 7098% of patients test positive . \n we evaluated the demographic , clinical , laboratory , and therapeutical features of a monocentric sle cohort according to the anti - dsdna status . \n methods . \n we identified three groups : anti - dsdna + ( persistent positivity ) ;

grade pc ( or = 0.68 , 95%ci 0.351.34 ) and a positive association with low - grade disease ( or = 1.42 , 95%ci = 0.812.47 ) .\nin contrast , high vitamin b12 intake associations with both hg pc and lg pc were not statistically significant .\nthe only significant observation was that high intake of methionine was associated with increased pc risk ( or = 2.1 , 95%ci 1.13.9 , p = 0.02 ) , when compared to intake 2.6  g / day .\nthese associations were somewhat stronger for low -

type allele\n cc  , versus 35% that carried either 677ct ( 24% ) or 677tt ( 11% ) . in controls ,\n54% were homozygous for the c677 t wild - type allele ( cc ) , and 46% were either homozygous ( tt : 37% ) or heterozygous ( ct : 9% ) carriers of the mthfr variant ; these variants were in hwe ( p = 0.27 ) .\nsixty - six percent of pc cases were wild type for the a1298c variant , and 35% carried the heterozygous ( 1298ac : 31% ) or homozygous ( 1298cc : 4% ) variant .\nfifty - three percent of the controls were homozygous for the a1298c wild - type allele ( aa ) , and 47% were either homozygous ( cc : 6% ) or heterozygous ( ca : 41% ) carriers of the mthfr variant , and they did not deviate from hwe ( p = 0.41 ) .\nwe observed no significant association between carrying the mthfr c677 t ( or = 0.7 , 95%ci 0.31.3 ) or mthfr a1298c ( or = 0.70 , 95%ci 0.371.33 , p = 0.28 ) and pc risk ( table 3 ) . to further evaluate the interaction of high methionine intake and pc risk association by mthfr genotypes , we measure or and 95%ci in pc cases .\nthe association between higher methionine intake and pc risk did not vary significantly by mthfr c677 t genotype ( table 4 ) .\nhowever , we observed considerable variation between methionine intake and pc risk in carriers of mthfr a1298c ( or = 6.7 , 95%ci 1.627.8 ) compared to noncarriers ( or = 1.0 , 95%ci = 0.23.9 ) .\nthe cross - product term for mthfr a1298c and methionine was statistically significant ( p = 0.045 ) .\nthus , high methionine intake association with pc risk seems to be linked to the mthfr a1298c polymorphism in this population .\n  our key findings were that high intake of methionine , which after its conversion to s - adenosylmethionine becomes the principal methyl donor for dna methylation , was associated with higher overall risk of pc and that association was only evident in men with carriers of the mthfr a1298c genotype .\nassociations between b vitamins and pc risk were unremarkable and inconsistent and not modified by mthfr genotypes .\nour findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excessive intake of a key one - carbon cycle nutrient may be associated with pc risk , particularly in carriers of the mthfr a1298c genotype .\nthis increased pc risk is possibly due to acceleration of growth of preexisting neoplasms , though these results require validation in other and larger datasets .  \nmechanisms by which higher methionine intake could increase pc risk remain speculative . although these results could have been due to chance alone , methionine is the key player in the one - carbon metabolism cycle as after conversion to s - adenosylmethionine it becomes the principal methyl donor for dna methylation , an epigenetic phenomenon associated with cancer .\nour findings that high methionine intakes were associated with increased pc risk , may imply that methionine availability at higher than optimal levels may lead to higher bioavailability of s - adenosylmethionine to donate methyl groups to dna , resulting in dna hypermethylation of regulatory regions of key genes , including tumor suppressors .\nfor example , hypermethylation of the cpg promoter sequences of tumor suppressor genes and the gstp - p1 ( glutathione - s - transferase ) gene is the most frequent alteration in pc cells and may be associated with prostatic tumorigenesis .\nalternatively , higher bioavailable methionine levels could also disrupt the physiologic equilibrium concentrations of s - adenosylmethionine and homocysteine , reducing mthfr activity [ 43 , 44 ] , and thus induce genome - wide hypomethylation , a hallmark of cancer .\nin addition to higher dietary intakes , methionine can also be regenerated if more circulating 5-methyl thf is available to remethylate homocysteine to methionine , which may be the case when folate intake is high .\nhowever , > 700  mcg / day of folate intake through diet and supplements have a weak inverse association with pc risk , as reported by others , as well as vitamin b6 taken at higher than recommended levels , though these were not seen in the current study . together\n, our findings suggest that the driver in the one - carbon metabolism pathway in diseased pc tissues may be methionine and not folate and that previous inconsistent findings in relation to folate intake or in circulation and higher pc risk could be attributed to cohorts in which methionine metabolism is impaired [ 5 , 46 ] , though of course this is purely speculative and future larger studies are needed to confirm our findings .  \nwe found no evidence for an association between mthfr gene variants and pc risk , consistent with findings from others .\ncarriers heterozygous for c677 t have a 35% reduction of mthfr activity while homozygous c677c carriers have 70% less mthfr enzymatic activity .\nthe c677 t variant lies in the catalytic domain at the nh2-terminal region of the protein , while the a1298c variant lies on the regulatory domain of the mthfr enzyme , at the cooh - terminal region of the protein , where s - adenosyl - methionine binds , allosterically inhibiting mthfr . in our study\n, higher intakes of methionine reported by pc cases may further diminish mthfr function , which would diminish availability of 5-methyl thf to remethylate homocysteine into methionine , which in turn may cause homocysteine accumulation , an effect that has been associated with adenocarcinomas of the breast and ovary [ 56 , 57 ] .  \nassociations between pc risk and higher intakes of folate , vitamin b6 , and vitamin b12 were not evident .\nalthough we can not rule out the possibility that our null associations could have been due to a limited sample size , confirming these findings in a larger study will be important .\nulrich et al .   observed an increased colorectal adenoma risk in individuals with lower intakes of folate and b - vitamins , particularly in elder populations ( over 60  yr old ) , suggesting that age may modify the association between folate and cancer risk .\nour findings showed that higher intakes of vitamin b12 , a cofactor in the reaction of methionine synthase to regenerate methionine from homocysteine , was unrelated to pc risk in contrast to a prior study , which showed increased overall pc risk .\ntogether , our results could indicate that methionine metabolism may be impaired in older men who develop pc , and that consuming higher intakes of methionine may aggravate this impairment .\nthis effect could be even more pronounced in individuals carrying the mthfr a1298c genetic variant .\nfuture research is needed to understand the underlying mechanism for these associations , while more studies are needed to determine whether the effect of high dietary methionine would cause methylation alterations .  \nthe main limitation of this study is the small sample size and consequent inability to adequately evaluate the role of common variants in the mthfr , which limited our ability for stratified analyses by pc grade .\nalso , the small sample size leads to concerns about type i errors for our significant findings and type ii errors for our null observations . in this study ,\nafrican americans were at higher risk for pc in general , though race / ethnic - specific analyses would benefit by larger sample size . another limitation is that dietary intake does not account for metabolized nutrients , and circulating levels of nutrients involved in the one -

wide transcription and \n the response of biological pathways and gene - families , for isolating \n the genotype - dependent response to single - stressors , for defining \n interaction effects of mixtures at the transcription - level , and for \n assessing if the nature of mixture interactions varies across genetic \n background .\nour results for each of these effects are discussed in \n terms of application to adverse outcome pathways ( aop ) or risk - based \n predictions of stressors effects in natural populations .\naops represent \n a sequence of events that begins with a molecular initiating event , \n spans multiple levels of biological organization and ends with an \n adverse or toxic outcome at the whole - organism level .\nthe application of transcriptomics data to an aop approach \n has \n predominantly been used to interrogate acute exposures to single stressors , but in the current study the \n transcriptome response to single stressors did not always correlate \n with higher - level effects ( i.e. , growth and reproduction ) .\nmolecular \n approaches , such as microarrays , are typically used to study perturbations \n in molecular toxicity pathways .\nuse of \n this information within an aop framework should ultimately lead to \n predictions of effects at higher biological levels , which are currently \n still more useful in ecological risk assessment .\nhowever , our study demonstrates that this response relationship \n is not always clear - cut .\nfor example , cadmium elicited an adverse \n effect on both reproduction and growth in one genotype , yet a negligible \n effect of the stressor on gene - expression was observed ( only 9 differentially \n expressed genes ) .\nalthough our analysis was quite stringent by applying \n a significance cutoff of p < 0.01 , this conclusion \n was still maintained when a less stringent cutoff of p < 0.05 was applied ( table s6 in supportive \n information ) .\nour observed results differ from the literature \n where robust gene - expression changes following acute exposure ( i.e. , \n 24 to 96 h ) to cadmium have been reported , and these genes could be coupled with some known \n mechanisms of action of and response pathways to cadmium . however , our studies measured gene transcription after chronic ( i.e. , \n several days ) exposures to sublethal cadmium concentrations to better \n reflect the ecological realities of cadmium exposures in natural environments .\nmore complex regulatory pathways such as those \n resulting in acclimation have been reported following these longer - duration \n exposures .\nspecific detoxification mechanisms , such as metallothionein ( mt ) \n proteins , have an important role in the defense against cadmium toxicity .\nhowever , these mts , and other genes , are often expressed in a time - dependent \n manner .\nasselman et al . , for instance , showed a significant response of the four mt genes \n in d. pulex exposed to cadmium after two to eight \n days , but not after 16 days of exposure .\nthis may be due to the long \n turnover time of mts causing a discrepancy between gene expression \n and protein levels .\nsuch dynamic processes could explain why transcriptomic \n responses may not always correlate with higher - level responses for \n all exposure levels or durations .\nin contrast to cadmium , transcriptomic \n patterns in response to microcystis stress did show \n a complexity that mirrored results \n at the organismal level . in this case\n, the gene - expression patterns \n revealed that reduction in reproductivity and growth was a result \n of several different mechanisms , such as the lack of essential nutrients \n ( e.g. , essential fatty acids or lipids ) , or the presence of feeding \n deterrents and toxins , or oxidative stress . the mechanisms revealed \n by the transcriptional response agree with previous results at both \n the transcriptomic and organismal level .\nthus , combining the results obtained for the cadmium and the microcystis exposure , we show that the ability of transcriptomic \n profiles to predict higher - level effects is dependent on the stressor \n and exposure conditions under consideration .\nanother potential \n benefit of gene - expression data is to disentangle \n the variability of the environments in which natural populations reside . \n indeed , using conventional toxicity assays with limited apical end \n points , it is difficult to assess the complexities of natural environments \n that include exposure to stressor mixtures beyond their directional \n influences on toxicity ( i.e. , greater or less than additive ) . for \n example , gene - expression profiles provide a more detailed biological \n understanding of the mechanisms by which mixture components interact . \n\nthese data allow interactions to be assessed with greater knowledge \n than the phenotypes of , for instance , reproduction or growth by identifying \n pathways and gene - families that drive interactions .\nthe transcriptomic \n response to multiple stressors has been studied \n before in daphnia , but there is a clear difference \n between all these studies and our present study in the way these responses \n are analyzed and interpreted .\nthe previous studies have compared the \n recorded transcriptomic response to mixtures against responses to \n individual stressors , but have not formally evaluated interactive \n effects between the stressors . yet , interactions \n between multiple stressors , regardless of whether they occur at the \n gene - expression , physiological , individual or population level can \n only be judged against an appropriate baseline of additivity . by joining well - established mixture toxicity baseline models with \n gene - expression data the current limitation of providing mainly anecdotal \n evidence on mixture effects at the transcriptomic level may be overcome . the present study is to our knowledge the first \n to investigate mixture interactions with transcriptome data using \n the independent action ( ia ) reference model , which is typically used \n to set the baseline for mixture interactions between unrelated stressors .\nthe interaction responses of expressed genes \n identified in our study provided insight into the biological meaning \n of mixture interactions .\nfor example , the ubiquinone biosynthesis \n pathway was the only pathway significantly enriched with expressed \n genes showing a cadmium  microcystis interaction \n effect .\nubiquinone functions as an electron - carrier in the electron \n transport chain in mitochondria , and \n because its electrons are only loosely bound when ubiquinone is in \n a reduced state , it has been suggested to play an important role as \n an antioxidant in the oxidative stress response in daphnia .\ngene - families enriched with expressed \n genes showing a cadmium  microcystis interaction \n effect were mapk related serine - threonine protein kinases and collagens \n of type iv and xiii .\nmitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapk ) are \n serine - threonine protein kinases that are expressed in all eukaryotic \n cells and that are activated by diverse stimuli ranging from cytokines , \n growth factors , neurotransmitters , hormones , cellular stress , and \n cell adherence .\nmapk pathways have been \n previously reported to be involved in nutrient deprivation and responses \n to stress stimuli such as osmolarity changes .\nnutrient deprivation is most likely , as discussed above , a consequence \n of the lack of essential fatty acids in microcystis , while osmolarity changes may be a consequence of oxidative stress .\nseveral endogenous \n immunostimulatory peptides in insects that may serve as danger and \n alarm signals are derived from collagen type iv .\nalthough no interaction between cadmium and microcystis was observed with apical end points , these studies demonstrate the \n potential use of gene - expression patterns to better understand interactions \n occurring in stressor mixtures .\nin addition to mixture interactions , \n transcriptome data can also \n dissect variation introduced by the diversity residing within natural \n populations .\nin other words , these methods have the potential to disentangle \n the sources of variation that give rise to the most central tenet \n in ecotoxicology , the dose  response relationship . in the current study ,\ndifferences between the \n genotypes are reflected both at the organismal and the gene expression \n level .\npathways and gene - families enriched with expressed genes that \n show a microcystis  genotype interaction effect \n are not differentially regulated following microcystis exposure in the cadmium tolerant genotype , but are in the sensitive \n genotype .\nthis observation could suggest that genes involved in tolerance \n mechanisms to microcystis stress already have the \n basal expression level needed to cope with the stress in the tolerant \n genotype .\nthe reaction norm approach provided in the current study \n provides a method for visualizing this hypothesis .\nindeed , this hypothesis \n is only valid if genes in the sensitive genotype following microcystis exposure reach the same expression level as \n that of the constitutively expressed genes in the tolerant genotype . \n\nbased on the reaction norms , this was clearly not case for the majority \n of the genes ( figure 3 ; supporting information figure s9 ) .\nother mechanisms must thus \n be at play , for example those preventing that microcystis can exert its toxicity in the cell , to explain why the tolerant \n genotype shows little to no effects of microcystis exposure both at the organismal and the transcriptomic level .\nfirst , \n this tolerance could be acquired by limiting internal , cellular exposure \n to microcystis .\nmeasurements of internal microcystin \n concentrations , which were significantly lower in the tolerant genotype , \n provide added support for such a mechanism .\nsecond , the observation \n of a microcystis  genotype interaction for \n genes encoding trypsins and neurexins , suggests a role of these gene - families \n in the genotypic difference in tolerance to microcystis stress .\na previous study has reported both up- and downregulated \n genes encoding for trypsins in d. pulex following microcystis exposure .\nthese \n authors argued that this up- and downregulation is in accordance with \n the observations by agrawal et al . and \n\nschwarzenberger et al . who noted differential \n sensitivity of trypsins to microcystis , both at the \n rna and the protein level .\nspeculated that trypsin isoforms , which are more sensitive to microcystis were downregulated while less sensitive isoforms \n were upregulated .\nour data show a very different set of differentially \n expressed trypsin genes between the sensitive and the tolerant genotype \n and therefore identify those isoforms that can be considered candidate \n isoforms that may correlate with tolerance differences and that could \n be an interesting subject of more detailed future studies ( figure 3 ) .\nhowever , the function of neurexin in daphnia and \n its role in response to microcystis stress remains \n unclear .\ninterestingly , the trypsin gene - family is also enriched with \n genes showing a main microcystis effect indicating \n that some members of this gene family respond similarly to microcystis stress across both genotypes , underscoring the \n potential power of gene - expression data to accurately disentangle \n genotypic differences in tolerance . understanding the mechanisms that \n account for tolerance difference highlight the fact that these transcriptomic \n methods can provide ecologically important insights .\nfirst , the cadmium tolerant \n genotype proved to be also more tolerant to microcystis at the organismal level , while the cadmium sensitive genotype was \n more sensitive to microcystis stress ( i.e. , decreased \n reproduction after microcystis exposure compared \n to a control ) .\nsecond , the cadmium tolerant genotype showed , compared \n to the sensitive genotype , only few differentially expressed genes \n in the pathways and gene - families that were enriched with genes showing \n a microcystis  genotype interaction effect . \n\nthese observations strongly suggest that the cadmium tolerant genotype , \n originating from a historically , metal polluted environment , is better \n armed to deal with microcystis stress .\nmoreover , \n the common toxicity mechanisms between cadmium and microcystis that we hypothesized to be the armory for interactions between these \n two stressors , indeed provided the arms that enable the cadmium tolerant \n genotype to also better cope with microcystis stress . \n\npathways and gene - families related to oxidative stress , food quality \n and the digestive system were enriched in significantly genes that \n segregated the two genotypes .\nsuch pleiotropy , when a gene or pathway \n affects more than one trait , has been previously described as a mechanism \n that can provide  cross - tolerances  between different \n stressors .\nour experimental design \n also allows us to interpret part of the \n complexity of stress responses in a natural environment , that is , \n the genotypic - dependent response to stressor mixtures .\nonly a limited \n number of pathways and gene - families were significantly enriched with \n genes showing a cadmium  microcystis  \n genotype interaction effect .\nthese included the ribosome pathway and \n the histone 2a and 60s ribosomal protein gene - families .\ninterestingly , \n all of these pathways and gene - families are related to transcription \n and translation processes , which suggest a general stress response \n likely to protect proteins .\nin addition , our reaction norm approach revealed in more detail \n genotypic differences in mixture interaction response : cadmium altered \n the gene - expression of genes responding to microcystis stress more pronouncedly in the sensitive genotype than in the tolerant \n genotype\n. overall , our results demonstrate the utility and also \n highlight \n some limitations of applying environmental genomics approaches to \n dissect the complexity of natural environments and the diversity of \n natural populations . we were able to interrogate the effects of mixture \n components and genotypes both independently and in combination , and \n identify interactions responses among gene families and pathways that \n ultimately contributed to tolerance differences between individuals . \n however , these approaches were less successful at linking gene - expression \n results under exposures to single compounds to organismal level responses . \n\nfuture studies should examine more single stressors and also more \n ( and also more complicated ) mixtures across a range of genotypes to \n better define the limits of complexity that these approaches can dissect . \n\nthis will help to further reveal the possibilities and limitations \n of these techniques to dissect more complex environmentally relevant \n exposure scenarios in an aop framework ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the \n present study investigated the possibilities and limitations \n of implementing a genome -

waste has been identified as a major challenge facing humanity today .\ncurrently , around 21,000 people die every day due to hunger related causes   and globally one in nine people go to bed each night hungry . nevertheless , approximately one - third of all food produced today goes to landfill .\nthe vast amount of food ending up as waste is not only a humanitarian problem , but also a serious economic and environmental problem [ 57 ] .\nthe world has limited natural resources and environmental benign cost - effective solutions must be found to increase food production , improve distribution networks , and promote effective food supply chain management practices . to alleviate the increasing demand for food production ,\nreducing food waste is an important factor that can significantly improve the overall efficiency of the food supply chain .\nresearchers in the field maintain that sustainable food production , intelligent management , and proper food distribution are the key factors that must be addressed if we expect to feed the predicted 12.3 billion people in 2100 [ 7 , 9 ] .\nso , reducing food waste becomes a priority , since waste will continue to be generated throughout the food supply chain if no action is taken .\ncompanies involved in the food supply chain and the population at large will continue to waste food as long as they can afford to waste .\nimportantly , food waste results in loss of time , effort , and the other resources that went into producing that food .\nother resources lost include fertilizers , pesticides , and the soil and water . from an environmental perspective\n, food lost or discarded each year accounts for 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions globally .\nthe scale of food waste globally can be quite staggering and several significant examples are presented in table 1 so that the reader can appreciate the magnitude of the problem .\nthus , governments , industry , and communities must work collaboratively to achieve policy and cultural change towards prevention of food waste at all levels [ 10 , 11 ] .\ntherefore , to keep pace with the ever increasing demand for food , it is essential to adopt a policy that says  no  to food waste .\ndefining food waste is not always straightforward since distinguishing between edible and nonedible parts of food is subjective . in some parts of the world\nnaturally , not every part of an agricultural or livestock product is entirely edible and there will always be unavoidable nonedible parts such as citrus fruit zest , fruit stones , bones , and eggshells [ 12 , 13 ] . in many cases , the difference between edible and nonedible is not clearly defined and depends on dietary habits ( consumption of bread crusts , apple or potato peel , fat on meat , etc . ) , food culture , and geographic location . in the present study , food that is not consumed by the end user , which includes the nonedible parts of the food ,\nall food products go through a life cycle , starting from the farm and progressing through processing , distribution , retail , and finally consumption and/or dumping as presented in table 2 .\nthe degree of food waste depends on factors such as ( 1 ) developed and developing country [ 6 , 14 ] ; ( 2 ) prevailing weather conditions and pest management protocols ; ( 3 ) storage , transport facilities , and processing efficiency [ 1618 ] ; ( 4 ) market demand and visual appearance of produce ; ( 5 ) consumer acceptance of produce   and consumer affordability to waste .\neven a couple of decades ago , food waste was not considered to be a significant economic cost or a waste of natural resources . however , growing public concerns about hunger , conserving the environment , and the effect of socioeconomic factors have accelerated research into food waste .\nfood waste research is aimed at finding better ways of using this natural and renewable resource .\nunfortunately , there will always be a certain amount of waste produced in the food supply chain .\nhowever , current levels of waste occurring in the food supply chain are much greater than other industries and arise from the lack of willingness or inability to coordinate the various activities along the chain [ 2123 ] .\ntherefore , to make the food supply chain more sustainable and effectively manage food waste , a much deeper understanding of the current state of affairs is needed .\nthis not only means food waste itself , but also means taking into account associated factors like greenhouse gas emissions ( ghg ) and the use of other resources such as water , land , labour , money , and energy . after taking all these factors into consideration , it is also very important to make the various stages in the food supply chain such as production , distribution , and marketing more efficient and sustainable .\ngenerally speaking , the literature in the field often reports the importance of effective food waste management to reduce problems such as large waste volumes going to landfill , landfill gas emissions , landfill leakage contaminating waterways , and costs associated with transport and handling of wastes .\nalternatively , many food wastes can be considered as a valuable source of nutrients with the potential to be processed into products to feed the world 's increasing population [ 14 , 26 ] .\nrecently , mirabella et al . reported a range of nutrients available from fruit , vegetable , dairy , and meat and fish wastes that could be used in food products ( gelling agent in confectionary , fat replacement in meat products , supplementary food products , and seafood flavours for soups ) and beverage preservatives .\nfood wastes have also been considered as a source of renewable energy with the potential to significantly reduce the current dependency on energy derived from fossil fuels [ 27 , 28 ] .\nusing food waste as an alternative energy source has the advantage of reducing the amount of waste going to landfill and diminishing the associated problems of gas emissions and groundwater contamination [ 29 , 30 ] .\nthe use of food waste also alleviates the problem of land competition between food crops and crops for liquid biofuels .\nthe present review provides an overview of current research into terrestrial and aquatic food waste and progress towards utilising the waste .\nthe review examines the various causes that result in food waste and also presents information regarding waste levels throughout the different stages in food supply chains operating in several regions around the world .\nalso discussed are the socioeconomic aspects of food waste , the willingness to implement food waste initiatives that promote efficient and sustainable food chain management practices .\nin addition , probable future trends and initiatives for the implementation of effective ecofriendly and sustainable approaches for managing food wastes are outlined .\ncrop waste begins at the farm and continues throughout the food supply chain . between farm and fork ,\nfood waste is produced by each of the six stages of the food chain as detailed in table 2 . in developed countries\nfood waste can result from factors such as produce sizing and aesthetic standards , produce quality regulations , production surpluses , and economic factors .\nfor example , in 2009 , italian agricultural produce estimated to be 17.7 million tonnes was left in the ground and equated to around 3.25% of total produce production .\nsurprisingly , some studies have indicated that the agrofood sector waste could be as large as 40% of the total production value , while studies in the netherlands have revealed that annual food wastage costs are around  4.4 billion ( us$ 4.9 billion ) .\nend - consumers waste around  2.4 billion ( us$ 2.7 billion ) or about 10% of all food purchased and the remaining  2 billion ( us$ 2.21 billion ) was wasted through the various stages of the food supply chain [ 33 , 34 ] . in a swedish study ,\n16 different horticultural products including typical fruits and vegetables sold by retailers were responsible for wastes ranging from 0.4% to 6.3% of produce .\nsimilar studies have also found that fruits and vegetables are the main source of household food waste and equate to around one - third of purchased food products .\nfor instance , in the united kingdom ( uk ) , potatoes came first in a ranking of 100 fruits and vegetables and accounted for around 0.4 million tonnes ( 10% ) of total waste produced annually .\naustralians , for example , throw away around au$ 1.1 billion ( us$ 0.84 billion ) worth of fruits and vegetables each year making them the largest food waste category .\nstudies have shown that fruits and vegetables are the most wasted food category among all terrestrial and aquatic food products in both developed and developing countries as seen in table 3 .\nmoisture content , temperature sensitivity , and delicate surface membranes make fruits and vegetables susceptible to spoilage during production , transportation , and storage .\nfor example , in switzerland , around 47% of all vegetables produced are wasted in the food supply chain . and\nin germany fruits and vegetables account for 43% of all household waste as seen in table 3 . in many cases ,\nthe results of these studies are not comparable , since they did not assess the whole food supply chain ( only looked at specific stages and waste types ) and were carried out by different researchers worldwide using different assessment protocols .\nfor example , a number studies on fruit and vegetable waste fail to take into account grains and root / tuber wastes . and\nothers have taken into account wastes generated from grains and root / tubers in an attempt to minimise and simplify data collection .\nmany consumer and retail waste assessments contain very little information about farm practices , processing waste , and wastes resulting from storage and transportation . in spite of their importance ,\nconsumers and retailers can not be considered as the only contributors to waste in the food supply chain .\nnevertheless , it is extremely difficult to obtain detailed information from all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain because of business confidentiality considerations .\nanother limitation arises from the types of measurement procedures used to record and analyse food waste data around the world .\nin addition , making comparisons is difficult because waste levels can be presented in terms of percentage waste , local currency , and even weight loss .\nfurthermore , variations can occur between different regions within a country where economic , social , and behavioural reasons may promote specific types of food wastage .\ndetermining waste levels in a food supply chain often reveals that they are high and costly .\nfor example , in 2008 , the united states of america ( usa ) produced three large waste streams consisting of grain ( us$ 34,791 million ) , vegetables ( us$ 103,417 million ) , and fruits ( us$ 62,146 million ) at considerable economic cost .\nfurthermore , each year , the usa produces more than 2.7 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables that are not harvested or remain unsold due to poor crop aesthetics and low market prices . moreover , most studies only measure or estimate a particular food waste and fail to address any trends in the levels of wastage .\nto remedy this situation , the united states department of agriculture ( usda ) carried out a detailed analysis to understand the variation in food waste levels between 1995 and 2010 .\nthis data is presented in table 4 and shows a downward drift in consumer waste compared to retailers waste , although consumers are often blamed for high waste levels .\nalso , over this period , retail waste has increased for most commodities especially grain products , while consumer waste levels have significantly decreased for some food products such as grain products and fruits . in particular , vegetable waste produced by consumers in 2008 and 2010 was significantly lower than waste levels recorded in 1995 . for developing countries , around 15 to 50% of all fruit and vegetable waste\nfor example , in africa , cassava wastes can be as large as 45%   and yam waste levels can reach 50% . in the philippines , fruit wastes from crops such as\nsimilarly , around 18 to 40% of all fresh fruits and vegetables go to waste in india every year due to the lack of refrigerated transport and high quality cold storage facilities .\nthis equates to an annual cost to food manufacturers and sellers of around us$ 71,481 million .\nunfortunately , much of this data comes from studies carried out almost 40 years ago and because no recent studies have been carried out there is no current assessment of crop waste levels .\nthus , there is a critical need for follow - up studies that take into account factors such as technological innovation , population growth , and consumer and marketing trends .\nit is critical for researchers to document current food waste levels so that stakeholders such as growers , processors , transporters , retailers , and consumers can take steps to address this growing global problem .\nthe second major food group after fruit and vegetables is grain . among the grains ,\nrice is recognised as the world 's second staple food and on average has a waste level equivalent to 15% of total global production [ 44 , 45 ] . however , this waste level is not the same for all countries due to variations in climatic zones and various production practices in each respective country .\nin particular , storage practices in both developing and less developed countries have been extensively studied and reveal significant differences between countries . for example\n, grain storage waste levels range from less than 1% in malawi [ 46 , 47 ] to 12 to 13% in bangladesh and 3 to 6% in malaysia   as seen in figure 1 .\nstudies have also shown that grain waste in the chinese supply chain is 19.0%   5.8% , with consumers accounting for the single largest portion of the waste ( 7.3%   4.8% ) . and\npostharvest and preprocessing cereal waste in sub - saharan africa was estimated to be around us$ 4 billion .\nthis extremely large cost equates to 13.5% of the total cereal production produced by countries in this region .\ninadequate storage capacity , poorly distributed warehouses , lack of adequately designed storage facilities , and inefficient transport and handling management lead to waste levels of around 20 to 30% of india 's total grain production .\nthis level of grain waste is estimated to cost around us$ 14 billion each year and is the highest in the region as seen in figure 1 . amazingly , this level of waste has the potential to provide the minimum annual food requirements of at least 48 million people in india . in pakistan ,\ngrain waste accounts for around 16% of total production , or 3.2 million tonnes annually , and results from inadequate storage infrastructure that permits widespread rodent infestation .\ncurrent data indicates that global postharvest crop wastes have direct consequences in terms of food security , malnutrition , and poverty . except for malawi , an african country reporting low grain waste levels ,\nother eastern and southern regional african countries have reported waste levels equivalent to around us$ 11 billion or 13.5% of total grain production .\nunfortunately , there is very little information available reporting grain wastes in central or west african regions .\nmost grain waste reports do record total percentage waste for each country but do not give individual crop wastes such as maize , rice , wheat , and barley . because these reports do not provide individual information on specific grain crops , it is difficult to determine which are more prone to waste . in spite of this\n, it is evident that policy , political management , natural calamities , storage , infrastructure facilities , and transportation are the main drivers for producing grain waste in developing countries .\nfood waste not only costs money , but also consumes other resources such as land , water , energy , and labour .\nwhen it comes to water usage , south africa 's ( sa ) food waste costs become significant since it is one of the world ' driest countries .\nfor example , approximately 30% of sa 's crop production depends directly on irrigated water , while fruit and vegetable production consumes around 90% of all irrigated water used .\nthe total cost of food waste in sa each year is estimated to be around us$ 5.27 billion and equates to 2.1% of the country 's gross domestic product ( gdp ) . furthermore\n, agricultural production is more prone to waste than processing , packaging , and consumers .  \nfigure 2 presents a comparison between food waste quantities and the food waste costs for each stage in the sa food supply chain .\nthis suggests that both stages are not cost - effective and rather prone to wastage . while consumer waste levels are relatively low , distribution and infrastructure waste levels are relatively high .\nthe results of this study clearly indicate the severity of waste levels within the sa food supply chain .\ngrain waste studies have mainly focused on developing countries , with very few studies reporting grain waste in developed countries .\na small number of studies conducted in the usa have only investigated grain waste in the retail and consumer stages of the food supply chain as presented in table 5 [ 13 , 5860 ] . it should be noted that in most developed countries grains are considered as livestock feed rather than human food .\nthus , there is a crucial need to undertake grain waste studies in developed countries and determine the alternative utilisation of grain and grain wastes as livestock feed .\nthus , the lack of reliable food waste data from around the world and the increasing importance of food security mean that significant efforts are needed to fill in the knowledge gaps .\nsome studies have just recorded food waste levels , while others have also highlighted methods for managing wastes .\nthere are numerous reports in the literature discussing various recycling and utilisation methods available for processing fruit , vegetable , and grain wastes .\nthe aim of food waste utilisation is to extract the maximum practical benefits and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill .\nalthough there has been extensive information discussing various waste recycling strategies for dealing with agricultural waste , there is very little information assessing the economic benefits of the various waste utilisation methods . at present , there are very few reports available discussing the utilisation of agrowastes on a commercial scale and methods to overcome barriers that currently prevent effective food waste management strategies .\nfruit and vegetable wastes including peels , stones , and fibres contain a wide range of natural compounds , while grain wastes derived from straw , bagasse , cobs , cotton husk , groundnut husks , and fibrous remnants of forage grasses are mainly composed of useful materials such as cellulose , hemicelluloses , and lignin .\narguably , grain wastes are the most abundant agricultural wastes and the most underutilised . on the whole crop wastes\nand currently there is a high demand for pharmaceutical ingredients such as enzymes , solvents , and surfactants all of which can be derived from crop wastes . because of the rich source of natural compounds found in crop wastes , the european union , usa , canada , japan , and malaysia are ambitiously developing and promoting an ecofriendly biologically based market .\nfor example , in 2010 , the usa placed a replacement target of 12% on all of its chemical feedstock and by 2030 it is expected that bio - based products will have a market share of around 25% . at present , only a small number of bio - based compounds derived from crop sources have made it into commercial products .\ntypical examples include ( 1 ) succinic acid from crops like sugarcane , maize , rice , barley , and potato ; ( 2 ) starch based plastic production from cassava , maize , and wheat ; ( 3 ) surfactants from tropical oil producing grains ; ( 4 ) fatty acids from coconut and oil palm ; ( 5 ) polymers , lubricants , adhesives , solvents , and surfactants from rapeseed and sunflower ; and ( 6 ) lactic acid from carbohydrate containing crops such as cereals , potato , and sugar beet .\nhowever , to date , very few products containing compounds and chemicals derived from crop wastes have made it into the commercial marketplace .\nestimates of market size , market price , potential bio - based share , potential bio - based production size , potential impact for local producers , potential local employment , and prospects for development are very low and rather poor . therefore ,\nbefore large - scale development of bio - based renewable products can take place , more detailed feasibility studies and practical business models are needed .\nthus , long - term collaborations between producers , manufacturers , and business are needed to undertake further translational research to bring these new and novel products to the marketplace .\npresent research has also shown that grain wastes can be used as a source of bioenergy in the forms of bioethanol , biodiesel , and biogas .\nfor example , bioethanol is currently produced from corn in the usa , european union , and china . in tropical regions such as in brazil and columbia\nunfortunately , because of the constraints imposed by available arable land , there is competition between crops specifically grown for biofuel and those grown for food and feed production . because of this competition\n, it is not feasible to increase biofuel production using currently available land and technologies .\nconsequently , current research has focused on developing more advanced or 2nd - generation biofuel production technologies that use wastes derived from grains , fruits , and vegetables . in the last decade\n, significant progress has been made in developing chemical processes that can convert agrowastes into ethanol .\nhowever , major barriers such as the high cost of pretreatments and inefficient conversion processes have prevented the commercialization of large - scale bioethanol processing facilities [ 7880 ] .\nfurther economic analysis has also identified costs barriers such as feedstock chemicals and capital investment that includes pretreatment facilities , fermenters , and steam generation systems as the main factors restricting large - scale processing facilities .\ntherefore , to overcome many of these barriers , further research is needed to improve efficiencies in current plant and equipment and to explore and develop new agrowaste conversion technologies .\nresearch into the generation of biogas from fruit and vegetable wastes has also been carried out .\ncurrently , municipal wastes are recycled through anaerobic digesters to produce biogas , but agrowastes are yet to be converted using this type of processing facility .\nthe main reasons for this are ( 1 ) providing a continuous supply of agrowastes to the facility and ( 2 ) developing cost - effective transportation between waste sources and facilities .\nthus , without a continuous supply of feedstock , the facility is unable to efficiently deliver a steady flow of biogas .\ntherefore , the continuous supply of agrowaste essentially becomes a vehicle routing problem ( vrp ) .\nhowever , vrp has not been specifically applied to transporting food wastes produced by a food supply chain . instead\n, some studies have considered transporting large amounts of food wastes directly between supply points and processing facilities [ 8386 ] . in the case of crop wastes , they are produced at farms , processing facilities , wholesalers , and retailers and are typically spread over fairly large regional areas including both urban and rural ones . therefore , there is a need to collect wastes from various dispersed locations and transport them to processing facilities .\nthus , collecting and transporting food wastes are fundamentally different from harvesting and shipping agriculture crops to market .\nthe difference arises from waste delivery trucks not receiving a full load at any one of the locations .\nfor example , a business may only produce a small amount of food waste that does not make a full load .\nthis necessitates the truck to make multiple pickups from other locations before making its delivery to the processing facility .\nthis type of truck routing is a major cost to food waste collection that has not been fully investigated and could limit large - scale crop waste utilisation . importantly ,\nwhile the impact of large - scale biogas operations using first- or second - generation biofuels is being debated , there is also considerable interest in developing small - scale biomass processing to produce biofuels .\nthe advantage of small - scale biofuel production plant is that it enables local communities to access a renewable energy source .\nsmall - scale biofuel plants can utilise locally produced food waste and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels and wood resources .\nlivestock and poultry waste occurs in the early stages of production with animal deaths and animals unsuitable for slaughtering . in the meat industry , the majority of the waste is produced during slaughtering and consists of various nonedible parts that are categorised as byproducts [ 87 , 88 ] .\nmeat byproducts consist of bones , tendons , skin , and contents of the gastrointestinal tract , blood , and internal organs .\ngenerally , meat products have a relatively short shelf - life ranging between 7 and 26 days .\nit is for this reason that meat products immediately go to waste if not sold within the labelled expiry date and this is the main reason for wastage at the retail stage .\nother reasons for meat product waste include packaging size and date confusion among consumers as detailed in table 6 .\nbuzby and hyman in 2012   estimated the total value of meat product waste in the usa at us$ 83,127 million .\ntheir study found that consumers and retailers were responsible for around 35% and 5% , respectively , of the total waste produced , while the total value of poultry waste was estimated at us$ 69,100 million , with consumers being responsible for 37% of the total waste .\nstudies have also revealed a positive growth trend in meat and poultry waste as presented in table 4 .\noverall , there has been an increasing trend in meat consumption around the world with the usa recording the largest increase .\nthe increased consumption is around three times as large as the global average ; however , at the same time , trends in retail and consumer waste levels are not clearly understood as seen in table 4 .\nfurthermore , a study carried out in canada analysing food waste data between 1961 and 2009 found that red meat accounted for 39.73% of the total waste and poultry waste was estimated to be around 40.74% . however\n, this analysis did not include bone waste in the slaughterhouse since no data exists .\nmoreover , it is crucial to note that these percentage wastes only reflect wastage at the consumption stage in the food supply chain and do not take into account farming , processing , and distribution waste data .\nsimilarly , australian consumers waste around aus$ 872.5 million ( us$ 637.5 million ) worth of meat and fish every year .\nunfortunately , meat and poultry waste has not been studied to the same extent as fruit and vegetable wastes . however\n, a limited number of studies presented in table 6 do indicate that most of the waste is produced in the processing of livestock and poultry and the trend is steadily increasing as indicated in table 4 .\ninspection of table 6 reveals that meat processing in the uk accounts for 56% of all wastes [ 36 , 93 ] and in the grouping of 14 european countries processing wastes vary between 35 and 42% .\nunfortunately , there is no data available recording the amount of waste generated during the preslaughtering stage of meat and poultry production . like fruit and vegetable wastes , meat and poultry byproducts\nthe broad diversity of products has the potential to be used in human food products , animal feeds , fertilizers , and biofuels .\ncurrently , both academic and industry researchers are investigating various methods of adding value to meat and poultry products and make better use of their byproducts .\ncurrent research , using the most up - to - date analysis techniques , has been aimed at determining nutritional properties , bioactive molecules , and other useful chemical compounds commonly found in these byproducts .\nmany of these bioactive molecules and chemical compounds have the potential to be used in fields such as cosmetics and pharmaceuticals . in many countries ,\nslaughterhouse wastes have already been used to produce cattle and poultry feed , since these wastes are an excellent source of many different types of proteins .\ntwo animal byproducts that have been used without further processing by the fast food industry are tallow and lard .\nunfortunately , consumer anxiety in recent years has restricted the use of these byproducts in the fast food industry . in many cases ,\nmeat , poultry , and dairy processing wastes have the potential to be recycled and processed into higher value and useful products . but inappropriate use of recycled meat byproducts can create major aesthetic and even health problems .\ntherefore , most countries have regulatory requirements that limit the use of meat and poultry wastes in the interests of food safety and quality .\nfor example , at one time , japanese meat and poultry wastes were extensively used in animal feed until a relatively low priced imported feed concentrate entered the marketplace . and\nas a result waste usage declined and out of the 20 million tonnes of wastes being produced each year only 3% was used as fertilizer and 5% as animal feed .\nthe remaining large amounts of waste were incinerated or ended up in landfills . in an attempt to reduce the number of enormous landfill sites , reduce the environmental burden , and prevent gas emissions , the japanese government introduced a new food - recycling law in may 2001 .\nunfortunately , just after its introduction , an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy was reported and created a very negative public response to food recycling .\nconsequently , public concerns and safety issues have prevented food recycling for human and ruminant consumption .\nthe only other way of processing meat and poultry waste in japan is via compost production , but to date there has been limited acceptance of this product by farmers .\neggs are an important food and are extensively used in cooking for the production of a diverse range of food products . in korea ,\nthe annual consumption of eggs was estimated to be around 540,542 tonnes and is expected to increase every year . because of the extremely large amounts of eggs used worldwide , there are also large amounts of egg wastes produced . for instance , in switzerland , 18% of all egg wastes occur during production , around 9% occurs in the retail sector , and a massive 64% is produced by consumers as seen in table 7 . in the north american supply chain , 31.4% of all eggs produced end up as waste . and in the usa around 9% of all egg wastes\nare produced in the retail sector and consumers produce 14% as seen in table 7 .\nimportantly , waste products from both poultry processing and egg production industries must be efficiently dealt with , since growth in both industries largely depends on effective waste management . in the case of egg production , eggs are vulnerable to bacterial attack if the outer shells are not properly and quickly cleaned to remove faecal particles which contain various microorganisms [ 101 , 102 ] .\nin addition , egg waste can also occur during transportation , distribution , and storage if appropriate supportive environment is not supplied .\nfurthermore , because of the extremely large numbers of eggs used worldwide , approximately 50,000 tonnes of eggshells is produced each year .\nthese eggshells contain high levels of calcium carbonate ( caco3 ) that could be used as an alkaline compound to immobilise heavy metals .\ntherefore , recycling eggshells for the immobilization of heavy metals in wastewater has the potential to significantly reduce environmental pollution .\naccordingly , there have been a number studies evaluating eggshells as immobilising agents for heavy metals such as chromium(iii ) and lead [ 104106 ] . however , to date , the practical use of waste eggshells as immobilising agents is still largely unknown .\nthe dairy industry , because of its worldwide importance , has been extensively studied to determine its environmental impact .\nraw milk is processed into products such as consumer milk , butter , cheese , yogurt , condensed milk , dried milk ( milk powder ) , and ice cream . in spite of being extensively studied\n, what is lacking is a comprehensive understanding of waste levels produced throughout the whole dairy industry .\nthe agricultural stage is often reported as the main source of wastes in the life cycle of milk and dairy products [ 108110 ] .\nhowever , studies in the uk and spain have identified the main causes of milk waste coming from poor product quality during the summer period , poor forecasting , packaging mistakes , and breakages occurring at the retail stage .\nthe study also found that poor sales forecasting , slow sales , and cold storage problems during transportation also contributed to the wastage of many dairy products .\nin addition , cleaning and packaging processes associated with dairy products were also found to significantly contribute to waste levels .\nfurthermore , dairy product packaging has also been found to significantly contribute to environmental degradation .\nfor example , the mexican milk industry generates between 3.74 and 11.22 million m of waste products each year , which equates to around one to three times the volume of milk produced annually . and , in the case of denmark , milk and dairy products contribute around 71,000 tonnes of food waste annually , while in the grouping of 14 european countries around 43 to 48% of milk and dairy wastes were produced in the processing stage . in north america supply chain wastage\nwas found to be around 32%   and usa retailers were found to waste around 9% of all dairy products as seen in table 7 .\nother sources of milk and dairy produce waste result from frequent product changes , but this can be reduced through appropriate product sequencing and more efficient product scheduling .\nother methods of reducing milk wastes include capture of fat , protein , and sugars from wastewater produced during milk processing using processes such as evaporation , centrifugation , ultrafiltration , reverse osmosis , and bioconversion .\nthese recapture processes can significantly reduce the amount of milk and dairy wastes being discharged into the environment .\nwaste reduction can also have a significant impact on product processing efficiency and improved financial returns .\nfor instance , cheese is derived from milk and is widely used as a standalone product and component of many food products around the world . during cheese manufacture , acidified milk is mixed with an enzyme to form solid cheese or casein and the remaining liquid is called whey .\nthe waste whey can have a negative impact if dumped directly into the environment . today , around 50% of the world 's whey production is treated and transformed into various food products .\ncurrently , there is a large body of research in the literature that stresses the importance of reducing milk processing waste and wastewater discharge into the environment .\nhowever , the amount of milk and dairy wastes being generated throughout the global food supply chain is still largely unknown .\ntherefore , there is a current need to undertake studies that can identify and document the magnitude of milk and dairy waste occurring throughout the global food supply chain so that proper waste remediation and management steps can be implemented .\nhistorically , fish has always been an import food source and even today it is one of the most traded commodities in international markets .\nit was estimated in 2010 that globally around 54.8 million people were engaged in aquaculture and the wider fishing industry [ 117 , 118 ] .\ncurrently , fish contributes around 16.6% to the total animal protein supply and 6.5% of all proteins consumed by humans worldwide .\nfish also provides high - value protein and a wide range of essential micronutrients such as vitamins , minerals , and polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids . because of the nutritional and health benefits of fish and other seafoods , the demand is always high and annual consumption is increasing globally .\nfor example , the demand for seafood in australia has steadily increased over the last three decades . in 2009 , australians on average consumed 25  kg of seafood , compared with 18.8  kg in 1995 , 17.3  kg in 1985 , and 13.6  kg in 1975 .\nthe data indicates that overall seafood consumption in australia has almost tripled over three decades .\nin parallel with the increasing global demand for seafood , there are growing concerns about the sustainability and management of the fishing industry .\nrecent studies have only discussed wastage in general terms and suggest that waste could be as large as us$ 50 billion each year due to poor management of seafood resources [ 120 , 121 ] . a recent article by costello et al .\nillustrated how fish waste could be reduced in a sustainable way if appropriate management changes were undertaken .\nthe study highlighted that the less studied fisheries have not been closely monitored or assessed , so there is no data recording the amount of waste being produced .\ndifferent types and quantities of fish waste are produced throughout the food supply chain , commencing with capture and ending with consumption .\nworldwide , around 130 million tonnes of fish waste is produced each year by fisheries and aquaculture .\nwastes are produced through by - catch , on - board processing , transport , storage , retailers , and consumers .\nfish waste generation begins during wild catching , with by - catch or unintentional catching of marine species being discarded .\nthis problem has been extensively studied and in spite of environmental and business guidelines there is still no effective solution to by - catch waste [ 125 , 126 ] .\nit is estimated that globally around 17.9 to 39.5 million tonnes of whole fish is discarded each year by commercial fishing operations . following capture ,\nprocessing is the main stage in the food supply chain where most waste occurs . during processing , only the fillets are preserved and the remainder of the fish ( up to 66% ) is thrown away as seen in figure 3 [ 127 , 128 ] . a study by gavine et al\n. found that the southeastern australian seafood industry produced fish waste estimated to be around 20,000 tonnes per year and cost around us$ 150 per tonne to dispose of in landfill sites . in reality ,\nnot only does the waste disposal have a significant cost , but also it has a major environmental impact .\ninterestingly , in the uk , each tonne of cod purchased by a processor costs about  2,000 ( us$ 3,129 ) and around 50% of the cod ends up as processing waste .\nregrettably , the waste only generates an income of  40 ( us$ 63 ) as a byproduct and in the worst - case scenario its disposal costs around  60 ( us$ 94 ) .\nsimilarly , only around 43% of shellfish and other fish species are suitable for human consumption and the remaining are classified as waste .\nit has been estimated that in the uk both meat and fish processing were responsible for about 56% of all wastes produced in the food supply chain as shown in table 6 [ 36 , 93 ] .\na study of a grouping of 14 european countries revealed that fish processing waste could range between 40 and 70% .\nthus , it is apparent from these studies that the processing stage is the main contributor to overall waste levels .\nresearch into retail and consumer waste has shown that consumers in the usa are the major contributor to fish waste .\ninterestingly , the trend in waste by consumers has steadily increased from 16% in 1995 to 31% in 2010 despite having efficient transport and storage facilities [ 13 , 17 , 58 ] .\nthe reasons for the high levels of waste by usa consumers are unknown and need further investigation .\nthe disposal route for seafood waste is not as straightforward as grains and other crop products .\nthis is because the disposal of seafood wastes involves stricter hygiene , safety , and management of environmental hazards during its disposal and in many cases its disposal is regulated by government organisations .\nfor example , in the uk , landfill costs are much higher for seafood waste disposal because the waste is not categorised as  inactive / inert  waste .\nfurthermore , regulations regarding the burial or burning of seafood waste are restrictive if there are any alternative utilisation pathways available . however , some fish farming businesses are paying higher landfill costs to dispose of fish wastes compared to other methods of disposal .\ncurrently , around 59% of all fish wastes go to landfill and only around 39% are reused or incinerated as seen in figure 4 . to reduce the large amount of fish waste produced worldwide , a number of alternative strategies have been developed to add economic value to the wastes .\nfor instance , two different methods , mass transformation and sorting , have been developed to improve the economic value of fish wastes .\ntypical examples of transformed fish waste include fishmeal , fish oil , fertilisers , and hydrolysates such as protein hydrolysate .\nalternatively , sorting involves utilising various fish body parts such as bones , guts , and fins separately to enhance their economic value .\nfor example , sorting enables the production of specialised products such as liver oil , gelatine , omega-3 , protein containing sports food and drinks , calcium , cosmetics , and pharmaceuticals .\nwider acceptance and adoption of both methods could lead to significant reductions in wastes going to landfill and reduce the damaging impact of fish wastes on the environment .\nfor example , converting fish wastes into fishmeal has been steadily increasing in recent years with many countries converting their fish wastes using cost - effective reprocessing technologies [ 118 , 133 ] . in spite of the reprocessing costs associated with converting fish waste into fishmeal ,\nfor example , in japan , 90% of the ingredients used in fishmeal are derived from fish wastes .\ncurrently , there are only around ten major countries converting fish waste into fishmeal products , that is , canada , chile , denmark , iceland , japan , mexico , norway , russian federation , thailand , and the usa .\nhowever , these countries on average are only using around 25% of their fish wastes to produce fishmeal products .\nimportantly , fishmeal contains essential amino acids and as a result it is currently the most widely used protein ingredient in aquaculture feeds .\nthus , fishmeal usage over a 50-year period ( 1960 to 2010 ) reveals its increased use in aquaculture , while its use in both swine and poultry feeds has declined as seen in figure 5 .\none of the contributing factors for this trend was the ban imposed by the european economic commission on the use of animal byproducts being used in animal feeds . and\nsimilar regulations in the usa have also contributed to the increased usage of fishmeal in aquaculture . in spite of fishmeal\nbeing used globally , there has only been limited use of other fish waste byproducts .\nfish wastes can also be processed to produce oil , silage , fertiliser , composting matter , and fish protein concentrates .\nfurthermore , fish wastes are also a rich source of chitin , chitosan , carotenoid pigments , and enzymes that can be used in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals .\nbut , to date , very little has been done to fully develop and commercialise these types of products .\nhowever , it should be noted that fish waste processing can be a difficult business in many countries due to problematic issues such as hygiene , safety , and environmental hazards .\nin addition , the most important factor that any business needs to consider is the economic viability of fish waste processing [ 140 , 141 ] .\nfor example , large volumes of both solid and liquid wastes are produced after processing nile perch from lake victoria in east africa .\nannually , around 36,000 tonnes of solid waste and approximately 1,838,000  m of produced wastewater containing valuable nutrients are discharged .\nthis rich source of lipids and proteins has the potential to produce value - added products through bioconversion .\nhowever , current fish waste management in east africa was found to be inefficient and nonprofitable and was unable to take advantage of the rich source of lipids and proteins present in the wastewater , thus highlighting the need for efficient waste utilisation and waste reduction strategies that can provide viable and profitable options for fish waste processing .\na number of aquaculture based industrial studies have examined various types of methods for dealing with seafood waste and its utilisation in australia [ 136 , 144 , 145 ] .\nfor example , fish wastes are a rich source of essential fatty acids and fish skin - and - bone parts are suitable mineral supplements in fish diets .\nhowever , further studies are needed to fully investigate large - scale profitable fish waste processing .\non the whole , fish waste processing and utilisation have steadily increased over the years , but several issues restrict its full - scale operation .\nin particular , environmental issues are major factors preventing large - scale development since fish processing plants can be significant polluters .\nobviously , there are good economic and environmental reasons to process fish waste and produce value - added products .\nbut further work is needed to develop effective and efficient methods of processing fish wastes at an economically viable industrial scale with as little environmental impact as possible .\nit is interesting to note that the literature in the field often overlooks aquatic plant food wastes .\naquatic plant foods such as algae have been used for both human and animal nutrition for thousands of years .\nthe earliest writings of the ancient greeks recorded in the bellum africanum , written around 45 b.c . , describe the greeks collecting seaweed from local shorelines and feeding it to their cattle .\nmany aquatic plants are very rich in protein and are a highly nutritional food that can offer many beneficial advantages as a food supplement as well as having significant medicinal properties [ 148150 ] . in the search for sources of natural antioxidants ,\nboth algae and microalgae are widely known and consumed in many countries for their advantageous health benefits .\nin particular , many algae and microalgae are rich sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids that have the potential to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases [ 151 , 152 ] . in asian countries like china , japan , and korea , the production and consumption of edible aquatic plants had a long tradition .\nthis long - standing tradition has resulted in the widespread incorporation of aquatic plants into the global food supply [ 153155 ] . rather than just relying on marine capture ,\ncurrently over 95.5% of the total global production of aquatic plants is supplied by aquaculture .\nthis equates to around 0.44 million tonnes of marine capture and about 12 million tonnes being produced by aquaculture in 2010 as seen in figure 6 .\nstudies have shown that the majority of aquaculture production , around 9 million tonnes , was destined for human consumption .\nphycocolloids were extracted from the remaining aquatic plants to be used as nutritional supplements in various forms of farm animal and aquaculture feedstock [ 156 , 157 ] .\nto date , there has been very little data reported in the literature and wastes levels produced by aquatic plant food industries remain relatively unknown .\ntherefore , there is a current need to undertake research into aquatic plant food supply chain to determine the current amount of waste , level of utilisation , and management protocols in use .\nhowever , in recent years , research has focused on using microalgae in the production of biodiesel .\nthe first is the high growth rate and the second is the high oil content . for example , microalga typically doubles its biomass every 24 hours under normal growing conditions , while the oil content of microalgae can range from 15 to 75% ( dry weight ) and annually can produce oil from 58,700 up to around 136,900 litres per hectare [ 158 , 159 ] .\ncurrently , biodiesel production depends on crops such as soybean , rapeseed , canola , sunflower , corn , palm kernels , animal fat , and oils .\nthe biggest hurdle preventing the full - scale production of biodiesel from these crops is land availability . since the land area needed by microalgae is small compared to oil producing crops ,\nthere has been considerable interest in exploring the use of microalgae as an alternative feedstock for the production of biodiesel .\nthe disadvantage of using microalgae for producing biodiesel is the high cost of production and separation that is needed to remove microalgal biomass from the growing media [ 159 , 162 ] .\nanother challenge associated with microalgae production in open ponds is contamination from a wide range of naturally occurring algae and bacteria .\nbut similar issues encountered for biodiesel production are also prevalent for bioethanol production such as algal biomass separation and contamination [ 163 , 164 ] .\ninterestingly , if aquatic plant food wastes proved suitable , they could also be evaluated as a possible feedstock for the production bioenergy products .\nat present , there is very little information in the literature discussing the industrial scale utilisation of food wastes at the local , national , or international level .\nfor example , fruit and vegetable wastes have been extensively studied and reported in the literature . however , food wastes produced and their utilisation in aquaculture , livestock , poultry , and dairy industries are rarely reported and need further research .\nmuch of the currently available food waste data lacks sufficient details and there is even less information discussing waste utilisation in the respective food supply chains .\nthis information is needed before any economic modelling can be done to determine the feasibility of new products and waste transforming facilities needed to produce a commercially successful business outcome .\nthe first step in developing a successful waste utilisation strategy is to assess the type and magnitude of waste [ 165 , 166 ] . once waste levels and their location in the food supply chain are known , it is now possible to start developing an effective waste management plan . in developing an effective plan ,\nseveral important factors need to be considered before successful waste utilisation can be achieved as seen in figure 7 .\nultimately , the main barrier to developing any waste management plan that produces a new product from food waste needs to take into account several strategic factors , for example , new market opportunities , market trends , current market developments , and producing a product that is competitive in the marketplace .\nfurthermore , each stage of product development needs to be carefully considered . in the case of manufacturing , a company will need to consider commercial opportunities based on a well - thought - out growth strategy , especially if innovation is a key factor of the product . for packaging and distribution , the product range and associated services will also need to be carefully considered with the view of preventing competitor copying and safeguards to maintain market share . from a governmental perspective\n, policies may need to be formulated that promote sustainable patterns of consumption and sustainable community lifestyles , foster new job creation strategies , and enhance the economy . for consumers ,\nthe combination of diversity , choice , and expectation of high quality produce is a very important issue in their selection process . in summary ,\nany new product produced from a food waste utilisation process that enters the marketplace will need to be both economically and ecologically sustainable .\nhowever , at the end of the day , it is consumer acceptance of the new product that is the deciding factor . a recent study by kummu et al\n. found that the preferred option for food waste utilisation was to use wastes generated from agriculture and consumers . from a global perspective , their study suggested that 47% of agricultural food wastes and over 86% of consumer wastes could be effectively utilised .\nthe study also found that the biggest improvements in food waste management would occur where the demand for additional food was the least .\ntherefore , to effectively manage food waste , there needs to be awareness of the benefits of postharvest waste utilisation by farmers , food processors , and government agencies .\nthis awareness is needed so that food waste management capacity can be built up and ultimately lead to improvements in converting wastes into value - added products .\nimportantly , it is also necessary to fully understand the size of the problem so that there are opportunities to improve food security and reduce poverty using effective waste utilisation strategies . in addition\n, the reduction of food wastes by effective waste management also reduces environmental degradation and improves economic sustainability of the food supply chain\n. however , the most important factors that will contribute to the success of any food waste utilisation strategy are its acceptance by the community at large .\nwhenever food waste utilisation is debated , it is generally discussed in terms of processing methods , but actual food supply chain losses and their true impacts are often undervalued and underreported . undervaluing and underreporting\nexploring these  hidden costs  usually acts as a catalyst for determining the scale of the waste problem , since businesses will only become aware of the problem when it impacts their bottom line .\ngenerally , food related businesses often resolve their waste management problems by keeping their profitability levels high .\nthey usually achieve this goal by reducing energy consumption , reducing raw material usage , and improving recycling activities .\nfurthermore , businesses will investigate the merits of managing wastes in terms of recovery and value adding as opposed to the cost of disposal .\nin fact , the disposal cost will have a direct impact on whether a business will go down the recovery and value - adding option or take the waste disposal route .\ntherefore , food waste management options will often involve a cost versus benefit analysis that ultimately determines businesses profitability .\nhowever , because of business confidentiality reasons , food waste management costs are normally not reported .\nthis often leads to partial and unproven estimates of the impact of food waste and makes assessments of waste management strategies difficult .\nfor instance , in many developed countries , the main driver for waste management strategies is government legislation relating to safety , handling of hazardous waste materials , and the environmental impact of the businesses operational practices . in developing countries , factors such as food type , processing facilities , storage facilities , transport , and even climatic conditions are the principal drivers in food waste management strategies . for example , the drivers for fish , meat , and poultry waste utilisation are health safety and hygiene risks associated with processing the wastes , whereas the economic drivers for fruit and vegetable waste management include microbial spoilage , costs of drying , storage , and shipment of byproducts .\nfurthermore , these drivers become even more demanding if the food wastes are to be converted into high quality functional compounds . therefore , waste processing strategies must be optimised to promote production efficiency and cost - effectiveness so that the final products are competitive in the marketplace . consequently\n, a cost - and - benefit analysis is of paramount importance before any business adopts a food waste utilisation and management strategy .\nthe most important factor that needs to be carefully considered when planning to adopt a food waste utilisation strategy that aims to produce value - added products is the consumer .\nexperience has shown that consumers are often reluctant to accept new products , even when they can see its benefits .\nthis is why consumer behaviour or habit needs to be fully understood when developing and marketing any new product .\nfor example , surveys have consistently shown that consumers are very concerned about the environment and whether new products are ecofriendly [ 178180 ] , with consumer queries often focusing on whether environmental guidelines were followed during product manufacture . in australia , around 62% of all consumer queries involve issues concerning environmental impact .\na similar study in sweden found that customers ranked product taste first , while environmental impact was ranked second .\nthe results of both studies clearly indicate the importance of environmental issues to consumers and how this translates into their purchasing behaviour .\nthese results also emphasise the importance of educating consumers on the ecofriendly nature of products processed from food wastes and their positive impact on reducing environmental degradation .\neducation is particularly important since most consumers are only aware of industrial pollution and wildlife conservation .\nin fact , consumer knowledge relating to the production and distribution of food they purchase and its environmental impact is poor .\nthus , consumers need product information so that they can make informed decisions and make ecofriendly based choices when selecting products .\nproviding information in the form of fact sheets at the point of sale or by environmental indicator labelling on product packaging would assist consumers in making informed decisions .\nin recent years , consumers have become more aware of increasing costs of gas , electricity , and petrol prices .\naccordingly , consumers have been encouraged to reduce their home energy consumption using a number of strategies aimed at improving domestic energy efficiency .\nunfortunately , no similar strategies have been aimed at raising the awareness of food waste utilisation .\nin fact , very few strategies have highlighted the negative environmental impact of dumping food wastes in landfill sites and subsequent greenhouse gas emissions .\nthus , consumer education and acceptance of value - added products derived from food wastes will ultimately determine the success of any food waste utilisation and management strategy . through education , consumers will see the value of these waste derived products and their positive environmental impact .\nthis will ultimately influence consumer behaviour and promote purchasing patterns towards food waste derived value - added products .\ntoday , there is a general absence of detailed information and understanding of the extent of food wastage at different stages of the food value chain from farm to fork .\nthe scale of food waste throughout the food supply chain is complex and can have a significant impact on a number of different fields such as agriculture , food security , economics , waste utilisation and management , environmental conservation , and human health . to resolve food waste problems and promote food waste utilisation strategies in any country\nthere are a number of hurdles preventing the conversion of food waste to value - added products .\nthese hurdles include developing effective cost / benefit food waste utilisation strategies , developing efficient ecofriendly reprocessing technologies , reducing environmental degradation , and public acceptance .\nglobally , a number of countries are tackling the problems associated with increasing food waste and food waste utilisation and management .\nfor example , several european countries are promoting utilisation and management strategies such as bioenergy production and regulating landfill costs to discourage waste generation .\nthe key to successful food waste utilisation and management is to develop appropriate ecofriendly reprocessing technologies that can convert all the valuable components present in the waste into valuable products and reduce the amount of waste going to landfill .\nconsumer awareness and education is one such challenge . without consumer acceptance of food waste reduction approaches ,\nthe present work has also identified the need for more detailed studies identifying where , why , and how much food waste is produced between farm and fork ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " in recent years , the problem of food waste has attracted considerable interest from food producers , processors , retailers , and consumers alike . \n food waste is considered not only a sustainability problem related to food security , but also an economic problem since it directly impacts the profitability of the whole food supply chain . in developed countries \n , consumers are one of the main contributors to food waste and ultimately pay for all wastes produced throughout the food supply chain . to secure food and reduce food waste , it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the various sources

51.6% versus 27.5% of patients with elevated and normal galectin3 , respectively ) ; however , this was due to the older age of patients who had initially had such a fontan procedure ( adjusted for age , odds ratio 1.8 , 95% ci 0.4 to 7.9 , p=0.44 ) .\nmost fontan participants in this study were classified as new york heart association ( nyha ) functional class i ( 74.3% ) ;

studies have not demonstrated any single circulating biomarker to be strongly associated with mortality or other specific longitudinal outcomes.31 , 32 , 33 this makes the strong , independent association between high galectin3 level and adverse outcomes especially noteworthy .\nthe small number of specific types of adverse event , such as arrhythmic death , precludes extensive exploration to determine whether galectin3 is associated with a particular subset of adverse outcomes\nwe did , however , observe a strong association between clinical ascites and high galectin3 level .\nthe pattern of medication use , more common use of loop and potassiumsparing diuretics , further supports a relationship between galectin3 and clinical volume retention .\nalthough it may be that galectin3 simply reflects disease severity in these patients ( eg , a marker of cumulative fibrosis or ongoing inflammation ) , there are several mechanisms by which elevated galectin3 may have a causal role in fontan deterioration .\na study reported , for example , that galectin3 knockout mice demonstrated less peritoneal inflammation in response to intraperitoneal thioglycollate broth injection.34 recurrent ascites is a common issue for adult fontan patients ; often it is not readily explained by hemodynamic findings , and the cause is unknown .\nif so , compounds under development to inhibit the actions of galectin3 might be a promising therapy for this challenging clinical syndrome .\nthe relationship between galectin3 and hscrp , a nonspecific marker of inflammation , is also noteworthy .\nprior studies have also reported a positive association between galectin3 and hscrp , although the strength of association has generally been weaker than seen in our study ( r0.13 to 0.25).24 , 25 , 35 further investigation is warranted regarding why these patients develop an inflammatory response , the typical pattern of immune activation , and the role of inflammation in the diverse causes of premature fontan failure and subsequent death .\nhigher galectin3 was also associated with lower egfr , as has been reported in prior studies of other groups of patients .\nthis may be because high galectin3 plays a causal role in progressive kidney disease , because fontan dysfunction is independently associated with both low egfr and high galectin3 , or because galectin3 handling is affected by kidney disease.19 , 36 because very few patients had low egfr ( n=2 , < 60  ml / min per 1.73  m ) , the last reason is unlikely to explain our findings .\ngalectin3 was higher in fontan patients than in an age and sexmatched comparison group , although the absolute values were lower in both groups compared with those reported in most prior studies , including those in the general adult population and in acquired heart failure .\nmedian galectin3 , for example , was 13.1  ng / ml in men and 14.3  ng / ml in women in a sample of 3353 community participants in the framingham heart study with an average age of 59  years.17 christenson and colleagues reported 20.3  ng / ml as the 95th percentile for galectin3 in a diverse populationbased sample of 1092 ostensibly healthy participants aged 55 to 80  years.18 the younger age of our sample likely explains the lower values .\nalthough reference values for other age groups are not yet available , we observed that galectin3 increased with age in fontan participants ;

wise intraexaminer comparison between the manual probe and florida probe by examiner 1 and by both examiners in ramfjord teeth revealed that cal obtained with the manual probe in group c and mild - moderate periodontitis sites was statistically significantly lower than cal obtained with the florida probe , whereas cal obtained with the manual probe in group d or severe periodontitis sites was statistically significantly higher than cal obtained with the florida probe .\nsimilar results were also obtained when the interexaminer group- and site - wise comparison of cal measurements by manual and florida probes ( m1 , f2 and m2 , f1 ) were done .\nthe group d and severe periodontitis sites are following the same trend as that of pd with the measurements by manual probe being greater than the florida probe by both the examiners , as the factors affecting the pd measurement by manual and florida probe are applicable to cal measurement as well .\nthe contrasting results of the cal measurement in group c and mild - moderate periodontitis sites could be attributed to the fact that in our study , in mild to moderate periodontitis group , out of total of 713 cal sites , 38.2% of sites had gingival recession whereas 61.8% sites had no recession , so identification of cej by florida probe in this group was difficult because of hidden cej .\nidentification of the cej is often complicated by its subgingival location and lack of clear demarcation felt by probing .\nin addition , lack of familiarity with the new probe ( florida probe ) might be the contributing factor in difficulty in cej detection .\nhence , the florida probe demonstrated higher mean cal in mild to moderate periodontitis group as compared to severe periodontitis group , whereas in severe periodontitis group , out of total of 1390 cal sites , 66.6% of sites had gingival recession and 33.4% sites had no recession . hence , detection of cej in this group was easier as the cej was exposed and the cej probe could easily measure the cal .\nin the interexaminer group- and site -

initiated short rna molecules that are considered to post - transcriptionally regulate the cleavage of target mrnas or just repress their translation ( 1 ) .\nit is estimated that mirnas constitute nearly 1% of all predicted genes in nematodes , flies and mammals 2 .\n, 5 .. the significance of mirnas had been long overlooked due to the limitation of technology and methodology until its initial discovery that two mirnas , lin-4 and let-7 , were found to control the timing of the nematode ( caenorbabditis elegans ) development through incomplete base pairing to the 3 utrs of the target mrnas to repress their translation 6 .\n, 7 .. shortly after that , reinhart et al . detected the existence of mirnas in arabidopsis by northern blot and the result suggests that this type of non - coding rnas may arise early in eukaryotic evolution ( 8) .\nthereafter , an increasing number of mirnas have been successively identified through computational and experimental methods in animals , plants and even viruses .\nthe regulatory roles of mirnas have been identified not only in developmental timing , cell differentiation , proliferation and apoptosis , but also in tumorigenesis and host - pathogen interactions 9 .\n, 14 .. it has been shown that mirna genes frequently coincide with fragile sites and hot spots for chromosomal abnormalities or locate near cancer susceptibility loci that correlate with tumorigenesis 15 .\n, 16 . , 17 .. although a large number of mirna genes disperse over the genome , clustered ones are found coexpressed as polycistronic units that may have functional relationships ( 5 ) .\nin addition , more than half of mirnas reside in introns of their host genes and coexpress with their neighboring protein - coding sequences , and some may derive from common primary transcripts and even share the same promoters 5 . , 18 .\n20 .. nevertheless , a sizable number of mirna genes come from regions that are distal from previously annotated protein - coding sequences and such locations imply that they probably derive from independent transcription units with their own promoters ( 1 ) .\na picture over the long course of evolution emerges , in which mirnas originate from different mechanisms to perform functional roles for the best utilization of genome materials .\nfirst , most of the known mirnas are encoded as polycistronic transcripts , suggesting that members of the same mirna family may evolve simultaneously and develop in similar ways .\nsecond , it has been known that a considerable number of mirnas are highly conserved in sequences among different organisms and the cross - species conserved mirnas possess a special  seed  sequence in their 5 terminus ; such a conservation suggests that these molecules participate in critical cellular processes ( 17 ) .\nthird , mirnas tend to target and regulate a set of mrnas instead of a specific mrna substrate .\nfourth , direct experimental evidence supports the notion that the mirna pathway is an ancient regulatory mechanism evolved before the divergence of multicellular and unicellular organisms ( 21 ) .\nfinally , special cases among viruses are worthy mentioning : due to their higher mutation rates and faster evolution processes , most viral mirnas do not seem to share significant homology with those of their vertebrate counterparts , even within members of the same family ( 10 ) . a reasonable explanation links\nthis phenomenon with their rapid adaptation to host environments , and the lack of homology poses challenges for computational biologists to precisely predict mirnas based on sequence conservations alone .\nit is noticeable that , with the development of the next - generation sequencing technologies and other endeavors , mirnas from various species are springing up in an inconceivable speed and greatly enrich the database 22 .\nit has been shown that an individual mirna is able to control the expression of more than one target mrnas and that each mrna may be regulated by multiple mirnas .\nthe 5 region of mirna usually contributes more to the specificity and activity in binding targets according to experimental evidence . the interactions between mirna and mrna are usually restricted to the  seed  sequence near the 5 terminus in animals despite the fact that most plant mirnas regulate their targets based on complete complementarity ( 25 ) .\nthe ~6 to 8-nt  seed  sequence is highly conserved among species and even a slight change in sequence may alter its target spectra . it is also suggested that the location of central loop in the mirna : mrna duplexes may play a key role in affecting the efficiency of gene regulation mediated by mirnas ( 26 ) .\ncurrent target prediction programs depend on the information from sequence , structure - associated free energy and evolutionary conservation to predict candidate mrnas 27 .\n, 28 .. those bioinformatic methods usually result in the prediction of tens or hundreds of targets for each mirna with high false positive rates ( 29 ) . therefore , further experiments of gain - of - function and loss - of - function are still needed and will determine how many of these predicted targets are genuinely targeted by mirnas .\nmirnas control the target expression by base pairing to sequence motifs in the 3 utr of mrnas with perfect or near perfect complementarities 30 .\n, 31 .. for example , in drosophila , a large number of mirnas have been identified to perfectly complement to the 3 utr of mrnas , including k box , brd box , gy box and proneural box , which are validated to mediate negative post - transcriptional regulation ( 30 ) .\nrecently , certain au - rich elements in 3 utr were uncovered to interact with mirnas and act both directly and indirectly as potent post - transcriptional regulatory signals ( 32 ) .\nanalysis of the mirna target sites indicated that genes with longer 3 utrs usually have higher density of mirna - binding sites and are mainly involved in developmental modulations , whereas genes with shorter 3 utrs usually have lower density of mirna - binding sites and tend to be involved in basic cellular processes 33 .\n, 35 .. these facts emphasize the importance of 3 utr in interacting with mirnas .\nit is also claimed that a small subset of mirnas from plants and animals exert repression regulation by specifically targeting the 5 utr of some mrnas 36 .\n, 37 .. lee et al . suggested that based on both hybridization energy and sequence matches , many endogenous motifs within human 5 utrs are specific to the 3 ends of mirnas ( 38 ) .\nin other words , many mirnas may contain significant interaction sites with mrna 5-utr and 3-utr motifs through their 3- and 5-end sequences , respectively .\nrecently , it has been reported that methods integrating factors such as 5 utr and protein repression level into the sophisticated target prediction processes greatly improved the possibility of identifying real targets 38 .\n, 39 .. in addition , candidate target sites of mirnas falling in the protein - coding regions are also identifiable based on computational and experimental approaches 36 . , 40 . , 41\n.. the fact that 3 utr is a significant yet not the only binding target for mirnas leaves one possibility open , that is , mirnas identify their targets by multiple pathways or modes ( 42 ) .\nthe impact of the interaction between mirnas and their targets is further complicated than it was thought . given the observation that mir-122 , a liver - specific mirna , binds to the 5 non - coding region of the rna hcv ( hepatitis c virus ) genome and induces the accumulation of viral rnas , it seems that mir-122 can act on viral rna replication rather than rna translation or stability ( 37 ) .\nin addition , vasudevan and collaborators demonstrated that mirnas oscillate between repression and activation in the duration of a cell cycle , and they identified mir369 - 3 in proliferating cells , which represses the translation of targets but switches to mediate activation process in cell - cycle arrest ( g1/g0 ) ( 43 ) .\nmirnas also appear to activate certain mrna targets in stress conditions , such as hypoxia and nutrient deprivation 43 . , 44 .. whether these up - regulation phenomena happen in special conditions or in ubiquitous regulatory mechanisms remains to be further illustrated .\nregulators of gene expression generally stand in a complicated network ; likewise , mirnas themselves are coordinatively modulated by different effectors when carrying out basic functions .\nas we know , a growing body of mirnas shows development- and tissue - specific regulation mechanisms although a considerable amount of known mirnas are expressed universally in various tissues and species ( 45 ) .\naccordingly , it is inferred that accurate regulation networks may exist in order to regulate the biogenesis and functions of mirnas .\nit is noteworthy that the multiple steps in mirna biogenesis appear to be a cooperated procedure and their influences are already reported ( 46 ) .\nin addition , other factors , such as sequence - specific rna binding proteins with double - strand rna binding domains ( dsrbds ) , are also known to regulate and control the function of mirnas 47 . , 48 . , 49 .. herein , we mainly focused on additional mechanisms ( snp , rna editing , methylation and circadian clock ) that all play important roles in controlling the expression and function of mirnas .\nample evidence has emerged and supported the idea that single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , created by changes in dna sequences of mirna - coding genes or in an mirna - binding site in mrnas , are able to affect the biogenesis and function of mirna .\nmany mirna polymorphisms are shown to be associated with diseases , because a gain - of - function of an mirna polymorphism may recruit or enhance the combination of the mirna to the targets , thereby strengthen the regulation effects , such as tumor suppressor genes ; on the contrary , a loss - of - function may result in losing control of the mrnas especially those oncogenes and drug targets ( 50 ) . in the case of mir-146a ,\na common g / c polymorphism within the pre - mir-146a sequence decreased the generation of pre- and mature mir-146a and led to less efficient inhibition of target genes involved in the toll - like receptor and cytokine signaling pathway , which contribute to the genetic predisposition to papillary thyroid carcinoma ( 51 ) .\nrecently , sun and colleagues performed a large - scale genetic analysis of naturally occurring mirna polymorphisms and argued that a single base alteration even outside of the mature mirna sequence may profoundly impact on mirna generation and function ( 52 ) .\nadditionally , it is by - no - means negligible that snps in target sites of mrnas may also result in the escape of inhibition or degradation by an mirna ( 53 ) . taken together , snp is becoming a noticeable factor in regulating the biogenesis and functionality of mirnas .\nrna editing is a site - selective modification of rna molecules at post - transcriptional level to yield a product differing from the dna template .\napproximately 16% human pri - mirnas are subject to a - to - i editing ( 54 ) .\nknown a - to - i editing sites residing in the mature mirna sequences are listed in table 1 .\nmirna editing may represent a fine tuning process in mirna biogenesis at different steps , resulting in variations of target mrnas and providing another layer of regulatory controls within the complex network of rna - mediated gene functions ( figure 1 ) .\nit has recently been shown that , the pri - mirna transcripts of some mirnas are subject to post - transcriptional modification by a - to - i rna editing , which is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminases acting on rna ( adars ) 55 . , 56 . , 57 . , 58 . , 59 .. as in the case of mir-142 and mir-151 , a - to - i editing at specific positions blocks the drosha / dicer cleavage in the maturation of mirnas 57 . , 59 .. therefore , rna editing displays a micro - regulatory role in controlling the mirna - processing machinery .\nin addition , edited mirnas may silence a set of genes different from those targeted by the unedited mirnas , extending the functional scope of mirnas but increasing the complexity of analyses at the same time 60 .\n, 61 .. furthermore , rna editing contributes to the diversity of mirnas by generating different mature mirnas from identical mirna transcripts ( 62 ) .\nit is described that some mirna genes are affected by epigenetic inactivation due to aberrant hypermethylation , which is characterized as early and frequent events in cancer development 63 .\n, 69 .. the expression of mirna genes , especially those locating near cpg islands , tends to be affected readily by methylation 63 .\nhan and co - workers found that the expression of about 10% mirnas tested are regulated by dna methylation based on a comparative analysis on colon cancer cell line hct 116 with its derivative , a dna methyltransferase 1 and 3b double - knockout cell line , and they provided evidence that mirna expression is strictly dominated by dna methylation and partial methylation reduction is not sufficient for the recovery of mirna expression ( 71 ) .\nthe expression level of mir-370 in human malignant cholangiocytes is significantly down - regulated by the over - expression of interleukin-6 and up - regulated by the methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine , indicating that interleukin-6 indirectly activates the expression of mir-370 by alerting the level of dna methyltransferase enzyme-1 and hasj4442 ( 72 ) .\ntwo components of the p53 network , mir-34b and mir-34c , are also epigenetically silenced in colorectal cancer due to the hypermethylation of neighboring cpg islands ( 73 ) .\nfurthermore , it is conceivable that dna methylation can affect the expression of transcription factors so that it may control the mirna expression in an indirect manner ( 71 ) .\nafter all , the mechanisms of methylation - dependent regulation of mirnas are of great significance and we are at the very beginning of fully understanding such mechanisms at molecular details . a minority of mirnas are found to be modulated in circadian rhythm regulation mechanisms .\nmir-219 is targeted by the clock and bmal1 complex ( 74 ) and mir-132 is induced by photic entrainment cues through a mapk / creb - dependent mechanism to control clock - related gene expression and to reduce the entraining effects of light ( 74 ) .\nsimilar regulative mechanisms were also observed by xu and colleagues , where mir-96 and mir-182 are reported to be involved in circadian rhythm regulation by modulating the expression of adenylyl cyclase vi in retina ( 75 ) .\nyang and colleagues used drosophila to investigate circadian clocks that may regulate the expression of mirnas and found that a limited number of mirnas , such as mir-263a and mir-263b , exhibit robust daily changes in abundance both in wild type flies and those reared in complete darkness .\nthe flies behaved in a model of reaching trough levels during the daytime , peaking during the night , and their abundances are constitutively elevated in cyc01 flies ( 76 ) .\nample evidence has emerged and supported the idea that single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) , created by changes in dna sequences of mirna -

depth analyses have demonstrated that the repression effect of mirnas can be relieved when they are subject to different types of stress , such as amino acid deprivation , oxidative stress and synaptic stimulation 77 .\n, 78 . , 79 .. in other words , some mirnas , if not all , may interplay with their targets in a reversible manner . in addition\n, there are clues suggesting that mirnas may regulate other non - coding rnas at post - transcriptional levels , including their own primary transcripts , and the result supports the possibility that mirna regulatory cascades are not limited to protein - coding transcripts ( 80 ) . however , there are still enigmas to be uncovered\n. mirnas with incomplete base pairing to their targets usually repress their actions rather than promote simple degradation .\nwe are yet to know the fates of these mirnas , that is , after repressing their targets , what are the molecular mechanisms to get rid of these mirnas ?\nup to now , a large body of evidence supports the idea that mirnas are involved in a broad spectrum of biological progresses involving negative post -

origin influenza a virus subtype h1n1 has been declared as the first global influenza pandemic of the 21st century . as of july 4 , 2010 , over 18311 deaths in more than 214 countries have been confirmed ( http://www.who.int/csr/don/2010_07_09/en/index.html ) .\ninfluenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family and are divided into three types , namely , a , b , and c. influenza a virus , in particular , represents a significant health risk to the public due to both its ability to spread rapidly among humans and being associated with major epidemic outbreaks .\ninfluenza virus is an enveloped virus containing eight segmented , single ( nonpaired ) , and negative sense rna strands that code for 11 proteins [ 6 , 7 ] , including two glycoproteins ( hemagglutinin ( ha ) , neuraminidase ( na ) ( also known as sialidase ) , two matrix proteins ( m1 and m2 ) , two nonstructural ( ns ) proteins ( ns1 and ns2 ) , nucleoprotein ( np ) , two polymerase basic proteins ( pb1 and pb2 ) , polymerase acidic protein ( pa ) , and basic polymerase 1 frame 2 protein ( pb1-f2 ) .\nviruses of the influenza type a are subtyped based on the ha and na , antigenic surface glycoproteins found on the viral envelope , which are essential for viral entry and replication in the infective cycle of influenza .\nthere are 16 hemagglutinin ( h1 to h16 ) and 9 neuraminidase subtypes ( n1 to n9 ) that have been identified .\nneuraminidases from influenza type a virus form two genetically distinct groups : group-1 containing n1 , n4 , n5 , and n8 subtypes\n, n7 , and n9 subtypes [ 920 ] . sialidase activity of the influenza neuraminidase cleaves the glycosidic linkage to sialic acid ( 1 ) on host cells and the surface of the viral particles to facilitate the spread of virions in the host .\ntherefore , sialidase activity is required for the efficient viral release , and inhibition of sialidase activity is proved to be effective in the treatment or prevention of influenza . in late 1960s , dana 2 ( 5-acetamido-2,6-anhydro-3,5-dideoxy - d - glycero- d - galacto - non-2-enonic acid , neu5ac2-en ) , a transition - state analogue , is identified as an effective first inhibitor of sialidase enzymes . using the advantage of structure - based drug design method , two potent sialidase inhibitors , zanamivir 3\n( relenza , glaxosmithkline ) and an ester prodrug oseltamivir 4 ( tamiflu , gilead / roche ) , were designed and developed for the prevention and the treatment of influenza and were complementing the widespread use of influenza vaccines [ 24 , 25 ] ( figure 1 ) .\nboth sialidase ( na ) enzyme inhibition and x - ray crystallography studies of these inhibitors also suggest that the strategy of designing an inhibitor of na that binds to the highly conserved active site of the na achieves the desired goal of activity against all influenza na subtypes , n1n9 , and influenza b viruses [ 26 , 27 ] . however , with use of these licensed drugs , several mortalities , severe allergic reactions , and neuropsychiatric events have been reported , particularly in japan .\nalso , the fda has issued a warning label for tamiflu after reports of serious psychiatric side effects in patients receiving the drug , especially in children .\nsome of the observed adverse effects have been speculated as a reason of nonselective endogenous human sialidase inhibition by these drugs , although no statistically significant relationship has been established till present [ 30 , 31 ] .\nfour types of human sialidases are known and have been classified based on their subcellular localization , namely , the intralysosomal sialidase ( neu1 ) , the cytosolic sialidase ( neu2 ) , the plasma membrane - associated sialidase ( neu3 ) , and the lysosomal or mitochondrial membrane - associated sialidase ( neu4 ) .\nhuman sialidases are involved in a wide variety of biological processes through modulating the sialoglycoconjugates .\nthey are implicated in various cellular events such as cell metabolism , cell differentiation , cell growth , and apoptosis including immune functions .\nhuman sialidases , although differ from the viral sialidases in their primary structure and enzymatic properties , show striking similarities in the tertiary structural aspects and active - site architecture .\ntherefore , active site - directed nonspecific inhibitors of viral sialidase could also potentially inhibit human sialidase isoforms .\nfor instance , inhibition of neu3 in normal subjects may contribute to the onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms since neu3 is proved to be an important molecule in the neuronal differentiation . the above mentioned facts suggests that there is a significant need for viral sialidase selective inhibitors with other improved properties ( including increased efficacy and reduced sensitivity to resistance ) relative to the currently marketed drugs .\nthe structural analysis of various sialidase - dana complexes suggests that four main functional groups that bind to the enzyme active site are 2-carboxylate , 4-hydroxyl , 5-n - acetyl , and 6-glycerol moiety ( figure 2 ) .\nmore importantly , 2-carboxylate ( -c1o1ao1bh ) group is absolutely necessary for the inhibitory activity .\nit is well established that the arg triad in the immediate vicinity of the carboxylate group plays a key role in orienting and stabilizing various inhibitors [ 37 , 38 ] . in our previous work , we reported a series of amide - linked c9 modified dana analogues as human sialidase inhibitors , and structure - based methods were used to investigate the observed activity .\nresults showed that some of the c9 amide - linked hydrophobic analogues of dana are selective for human lysosomal sialidase ( neu1 ) . the mixed structure and sequence alignment of viral sialidase with human sialidases revealed that neu1 has a higher sequence similarity ( 34% ) as compared to other isoforms ( 2527% ) , and the active site architecture of neu1 is more closely related to viral sialidase than other isoforms though striking variations are present .\nin particular , near c9 of dana , the conserved e277 of viral sialidase that forms important h - bonds with o8 and o9 hydroxyl groups of dana is also conserved in neu1 with a chemically equivalent residue ( asp263 ) , while other isoforms are substituted with nonpolar amino acid residues ( figure 2 ) . considering this\n, we planned to evaluate certain c9 dana amides , ( i ) , against viral sialidases and compared their selectivity over human sialidases .\nherein , we report the viral sialidase inhibitory activities and complete experimental details of synthesis and screening of c9 amide - linked hydrophobic analogues.(i )\na set of c9 n - acyl neu5ac2en derivatives were synthesized according to the procedures previously described .\nthe viral sialidase inhibitory activities of compounds ( 514 ) were evaluated against three different strains of influenza a virus ( h1n1 , h3n2 , and h5n3 ) using dana 2 as a reference compound .\nresults expressed as 50% inhibitory concentration ( ic50 ) values are presented in table 1 together with the previously reported human sialidase inhibitory activities of compounds ( for 2 , 5 , and 8) .\nsome compounds demonstrate moderate to good inhibitory activities against viral sialidases with ic50 of lower than 100  m . moreover , most of the compounds show more activity against sialidase of h1n1 strain over other tested viral strains .\nthe substitution of the small groups by higher homologues at c9 amide position results in a substantial loss of inhibitory activity and might reflect a spatial restriction in the active site of viral sialidases .\nin particular , the bulky groups of compounds ( 6 , 7 , and 14 ) severely diminish the activity , and this effect becomes more evident with other viral sialidases of h3n2 and h5n3 .\nindeed , compounds 5 ( 22  m for h1n1 , 34  m for h3n2 , and 97  m for h5n3 ) and 8 ( 9  m for h1n1 , 16  m for h3n2 , and 98  m for h5n3 ) show ic50 values close to dana ( 1  m for h1n1 , 9  m for h3n2 , and 11  m for h5n3 ) and inhibit the viral sialidases with higher affinity as compared to other compounds in this series .\ninterestingly , the viral / human sialidase selectivity profiles of compounds 5 ( ic50 58  m for neu1 , > 1000  m for neu2 , > 1000  m for neu3 , and 580  m for neu4 ) and 8 ( 680  m for neu1 , > 1000  m for neu2 , > 1000  m for neu3 , and 825  m for neu4 ) are better than those of dana ( 143  m for neu1 , 43  m for neu2 , 61  m for neu3 , and 74  m for neu4 ) .\nthese data indicate that compounds 5 and 8 could be further explored for the design of viral sialidase selective inhibitors .  \na mixed structural - sequence analysis and molecular docking were performed to explain why there are notable differences in binding affinities and selectivities .\nthe crystal structure of h1n1 ( a / brevig mission/1/18 ) ( pdb code , 3b7e ) was selected as the representative for determining the information regarding spatial disposition discriminating residues .\nthe multiple - sequence alignments of the tested viral strains ( h1n1 [ acqp03468 ] , h3n2 [ acqp03475 ] , and h5n3 [ acqa6yj51 ] ) and 3b7e were performed ( figure 3 ) .\nthe best compound 8 was chosen to be docked into the dana 's binding site of h1n1 ( 3b7e ) , and then obtained protein - ligand complex was energetically minimized .\nwe can infer from figures 3 and 4 that the putative active site residues interacting with compound 8 are highly conserved in all three viral sialidases , except a striking difference at ser246 ( 3b7e ) and its neighboring residues .\nthis difference is positioned in the vicinity of c-9 of dana 's scaffold and could be a reason for differential interaction of the present series of compounds with their binding regions . taking a close look at the binding mode of c9 substituent of compound 8 in the active site of h1n1 , it can be seen that one out of two conserved h - bond interactions of dana with glu ( 276 in h1n1 ) is broken and a new h - bond is formed with ser246 ( h1n1 ) . in the case of h3n2 and h5n3 , this residue is substituted with a hydrophobic residue ala that can cause a loss of h - bond and a subsequent drop in the inhibitory activity as compared to h1n1 .\nthe cyclopropyl ring of compound 8 interacts with a fleck of hydrophobic surface mainly defined by the side chains of asn211 , ile222 , arg224 , ser246 , and pro227 . as seen in table 1 , the small structural differences at c9 substituents that likely interact with this hydrophobic surface had significant differences in the inhibitory activity .\nthe above mentioned observations indicate that cyclopropyl group can form optimal interactions , and even a slight increase in size of the substituent can probably cause repulsive interactions with this hydrophobic surface .\nalthough the difference is not significant , the slightly increased activity of compound 8 over compound 5 could be due to the conformational rigidity of the cyclopropyl group that is also proposed for its decreased activity against human sialidases as compared to dana .\nin summary , this study describes a set of c9 n - acyl neu5ac2en mimetics as viral sialidase selective inhibitors .\nthe results indicate that the cyclopropyl substituent at c9 shows an optimal inhibitory activity for the current series of compounds and also exhibits a better selectivity profile than the reference compound dana .\nmultiple sequence alignment and molecular docking studies give some possible explanations on the interaction of compound 8 with the viral sialidases .\nwe strongly believe that the information derived from present study could be potentially utilized for the design of selective viral sialidase inhibitors over human sialidases and such selective inhibitors are of interest in the context of the future development of anti -

de - sac after instillation .\nthe general consensus in the literature is that schirmer i with anesthesia does not measure true basal secretion [ 67 ] .\nincomplete anesthesia ( including sensation of the lower lid ) and psychogenic variables often serve to maintain a level of reflex tearing after instillation of the anesthetic [ 69 ] .\nadditionally , use of anesthetic has been implicated in disruption of cell junctions which may increase surface staining leading to erroneous conclusions during the evaluation of surface integrity . as corneal and/or conjunctival staining\nis routinely performed after the schirmer test , the inclusion of anesthetic may inadvertently result in misclassification of the presence and/or severity of dry eye .\nwhether with or without the use of anesthetic , numerous review and research papers have documented high variability , low reproducibility and poor correlation with other signs and symptoms of dry eye [ 1116 ] .\nalthough some of the variability associated with the schirmer i test may be minimized in moderate to severe aqueous deficient dry - eyed individuals , poor reproducibility severely limits the utility of the this test as a means of quantifying efficacy relating to dry eye therapy . in an attempt to minimize variability , numerous variations of the schirmer test ( in addition to anesthetic use ) ,\nhave been proposed including closing the eyes , using dim light , reducing the test time and the use of different filter materials . to date , no such alteration in methodology has resulted in a consistent improvement in schirmer reproducibility or diagnostic sensitivity .\nadditional limitations associated with the schirmer test have been described in the past 20 years [ 11 , 16 ] . included in this list\nis the fact that the testing time ( 5 min ) is too long [ 17 , 18 ] ; the paper strip may absorb tears unevenly ( depending on tear composition ) ; there is potential for evaporative loss ; the test causes discomfort and there is no true agreement for lower  cut off  wetting length limits in non dry - eyed patients or those with dry eye disease .\nif we consider all the vagaries discussed above , it should not be surprising that there remains a lack of consensus as to what schirmer score truly is indicative of dry eye syndrome .\nscores collected without anesthesia ranging from 5 to < 10 mm and < 8 mm with anesthesia are generally regarded as abnormal , signifying the presence of dry eye .\nmuch of the difficulty in defining wetting limits for diagnostic purposes can be summarized by a statement paraphrased from cho    schirmer values are too variable such that no definite limit for normal tear production can be determined .\n despite significant effort , there have been only a very small number of studies that have found a wetting cut off point that is correlated with another sign or symptom of dry eye .\nfurthermore , the range of values is such that regardless of a cut off point , false negative and/or positive identification of dry - eyed subjects is common . despite the paucity of reproducible data ,\nthe recent dews 2007 report   has suggested a reasonable cutoff value of  5 mm in 5 min for a dry eye diagnosis .\nthe phenol red thread ( prt ) test was introduced in 1982   and was developed to overcome many of the disadvantages of the schirmer test as described in the previous section including high variability , poor reproducibility , and low sensitivity for detecting dry eyes .\nthe test consists of a cotton thread impregnated with phenol red which is ph sensitive .\nwhen wet with tears , which are slightly alkaline , the thread turns from yellow to red .\nthe  red  portion of the thread is analogous to wetting of the schirmer strip and the length of red color in mm is recorded .\nstandard clinical data suggests that for a 15-s test , wetting lengths should normally be between 9 and 20  mm .\nmethodologically , the prt test is similar to the schirmer test , although there are some potential advantages that include the fact that there is little to no sensation from the thread , thus less potential for reflex .\nfurthermore , the test time is only 15  s per eye , the eyes remain open and are free to blink , and no anesthetic is required [ 16 , 2024 ] . despite these potential advantages , the prt is used rarely in clinical practice or in clinical development .\ntwo possible reasons for this are that the threads are difficult to handle initially due to their light and flexible nature and the threads are only manufactured in japan , making their supply costly and often requiring special ordering . although the prt test is not a standard clinical test , its potential advantages over the schirmer i test have generated interest in assessing its reproducibility and utility .\nseveral studies have found the prt test to be more repeatable than the schirmer test ( with and without anesthestic ) as well as more reliable in diagnosing dry eye [ 20 , 2425 ] .\nchiang et al .   compared 66 normal eyes and 14 dry eyes ( de ) using both schirmer i and prt . in 28 eyes ,\nthe following data were reported : normal prt  =  20.3    8.7 mm vs de prt  =  8.1    8.0 mm ( p  <  0.005 ) ; normal schirmer  =  10.0    7.9 mm vs de schirmer  =  14.6    9.8 mm ( p  =  0.33 ) .\nbased on these data , the authors concluded that the likelyhood of a false positive was 3% using prt and 18% using schirmer .\nan estimate of the reproducibility of the measurements was achieved through comparison of data collected on two successive days .\npatel et al .   concluded that the prt test could accurately differentiate aqueous dry eyed subjects from non dry - eyed subjects , although in his study , the thread was left in place for 120  s. in this same study , it was concluded that the prt test could not differentiate between dry eye and non - dry eye if both aqueous and lipid deficient dry - eyed individuals were lumped together . from a limited number of studies\n, it generally appears that the prt outperforms the schirmer test in the areas of reproducibility and reliability .\nglobal data interpretation however must proceed with caution , as several of the studies addressing repeatability were performed on non dry - eyed subjects , thus calling into question the true utility of the findings with respect to use in a dry - eyed population .\nnichols et al . [ 13 , 26 ] analysis of reliability and correlation of clinical measurements of dry eye have found that positive correlations do exist between ( a ) schirmer and fluorescein staining , ( b ) prt and both fluorescein and rose bengal staining , and ( c ) schirmer and prt . what is disturbing , however , is that although these positive correlations were found , only 31% of dry eye patients had confirmatory tests for dry eye as evidenced by two positive tests out of the six possible tests performed to diagnose dry eye .\nthese tests included fluorescein staining , rose bengal staining , prt , schirmer , tear meniscus height and tear film break - up time ( tbut ) .\nthese finding highlight the poor correlation that exists between all the tests as well as the difficulty in selecting entry criteria for a therapeutic drug study in the dry eye patient population .\nsaleh   suggests that the poor correlation between tests is as a result of the fact that each test utilizes a different mechanism to assess the ocular surface .\ntherefore , due to the multifactorial nature of dry eye , many mechanisms do not apply to the individual dry - eye patient .\nsaleh   further demonstrated that in a cataract population being screened for surgery , neither schirmer nor prt results agreed with symptoms ( 28/103 patients were symptomatic of dry eye based on questionnaire ) and that prt results showed no correlation with schirmer results .\nin addition to clinical utility , the question that has surfaced repeatedly is  what does the prt actually measure ? \nnumerous studies now suggest that the prt measures a representation of fluid stored in the lower cul de sac plus a component of tear secretion ( basal and/or low grade reflex ) [ 16 , 2324 ] .\na true measure of reflex secretion would require an absorption capacity far in excess of what a prt is capable of .\nin addition , in 15  s , only approximately 0.5  l of tears or 7.5% of the average normal volume is collected , thus raising the question of how reliable an overall estimate of volume could be achieved with the prt test .\nit has been suggested that the ability of the prt to differentiate aqueous dry - eyed from non - dry - eyed subjects is due to the tests ability to first absorb the tears naturally present in the lacrimal lake and then continue to measure the replenishment of fluid into the lake as a result of basal flow and/or mild stimulation .\nsubjects with aqueous deficiency can not replenish their fluid as quickly , hence less wetting of the thread occurs . blades and patel   have argued that the length of the prt test be extended past 15 s as they and others have demonstrated that wetting is not linear and with the threads they employed , reached equilibrium in 120 s. further adding complexity to our understanding of  what is being measured  is the possibility that the composition of the tear fluid can influence wetting length .\nboth lipids and mucins can influence flow and it has been demonstrated that in comparison to migration of saline through a thread , variable tear composition likely increases the variability of both prt and schirmer measurements . increased test time may positively influence more than just differential tear composition and reflex tearing . it is argued that leaving the thread in for a longer time will increase the accuracy of the test .\nfor example , the measuring scale for prt has a resolution of 1  mm , thus if mean migration in 15  s  =  9.2  mm , then resolving power  =  ( 100    1/9.2)%  =  11% .\nif the test runs for 60  s and mean wetting is 18  mm , then resolving power reduces to ( 100    1/18)%  =  5.6% , thus increasing the ability to detect change and/or differences among test subjects . perhaps finding the time that provides the optimal balance between sufficient time for wetting versus minimal irritation ( causing reflex tearing ) is key . this may apply to both schirmer and prt tests .\nage and ethnic considerations may also be important in assessing the utility of functional testing for dry eye .\nseveral studies have demonstrated that prt wetting values for non - dry - eyed subjects are influenced by age ( prt reduces as age increase ) and by race [ prt values are lower in american caucasians compared to japanese ( living in japan ) ] [ 20 , 24 ] . in summary , although rarely used , the prt may offer an advantage over the schirmer test with respect to increased measurement reproducibility . to this end , it may provide both better diagnostic utility as well as serve as a more meaningful tool for therapeutic drug evaluation .\nthe prt test , however , still demonstrates variability and compromised reproducibility due to patient variation in the volume , depth , and shape of the lacrimal lake , the temperature of the environment in which the test is performed and the variation in tear composition among patients . additionally , the threads are difficult to handle and insert thus necessitating appropriate training .\nfurther research on timing of the test and perhaps the use of a closed eye   may further refine reproducibility .\nas noted above , neither the schirmer nor the prt appear ideal for the accurate and reproducible quantitation of tear production . however , alternative , more dynamic methods have been established utilizing the rate of disappearance of a tracer as the functional readout .\nlacrimal scintigraphy is one such method , which involves the application of a radioactive tracer such as technetium 99 ( 99 m tc ) into the lower marginal tear strip [ 28 , 29 ] .\nthe distribution of the tracer is monitored by a gamma counter , and the rate of change or transit time of the tracer through the system provides an estimate of tear turnover .\nalthough various quantitative algorithms have been proposed for this approach , the widespread clinical use of a radioisotope in humans is both undesirable and impractical .\nthus , methods utilizing fluorescence rather than radioactive decay were developed to enable assessment of tear turnover .\nfollowing topical ocular application , fluorescein sodium is thought to be distributed homogenously on the corneal surface and conjunctival sac after several blinks .\nimmediately thereafter , tears containing fluorescein are removed by flow and are replaced by fresh tears not containing fluorescein .\nthe measurement of fluorescein disappearance via fluorophotometry or other fluorescein clearance tests is used to determine tear turnover which is defined as the percentage decrease of fluorescein concentration in tears per unit of time ( % minute ) .\nbasal tear turnover , defined as the tear turnover at the lowest level of reflex tear production possible under physiologic conditions , is then utilized as an indirect quantitative assessment of tear production .\nearly studies with in vivo fluorophotometry utilized a modified slit lamp ; however , commercially available instruments ( i.e. , the fluorotron master ) have greatly aided in the standardization of clearance measurements .\ntypically , 1 to 5  l of sodium fluorescein are applied to the ocular surface and fluorescein concentration is measured at various intervals for a duration of 15 to 30  min [ 3033 ] .\nthe change is rate of decay of fluorescence is calculated for the entire test duration .\ntypically , a biphasic decay is observed , with the first 5  min representing initial reflex tearing after which ( 5  min outward ) , basal conditions of secretion are represented .\nit is this second phase of the curve that is used to extrapolate basal tear turnover .\ntear turnover data can then be transformed to flow and/or volume estimates . as alternative approaches to fluorophotometry , two indirect or ex vivo measures have been proposed .\nthe first , introduced by xu and tsubota , is a modification of the schirmer test with anesthesia .\nfive minutes after co - application of fluoroescein and anesthetic , schirmer strips are inserted .\nthe length of wetting is recorded after 5  min and the intensity of strip staining is compared to a standard color plate .\nalthough clinically practical , this approach has been criticized for being semi - quantitative at best .\nthus , as a potential improvement , afonso et al .   described a method where following instillation of fluorescein , tears were collected with a porous polyester rod .\ndata reported in the literature using each of these techniques suggest that measurement of tear clearance provides a more reliable and objective endpoint for the diagnosis of dry eye compared to schirmer or prt [ 3039 ]\ntear film fluorophotometry remains predominantly a research tool due to the cost of the instrumentation required to perform such studies .\nfirst , any disturbance of the corneal surface , such as occurs in dry eye , may alter the corneal uptake of fluorescein from the tear film .\nthis can result in a change to the monoexponential decay rate of fluorescein used in the calculation of tear production [ 30 , 38 ] .\ntherefore , in clinical studies used to asses the efficacy of drugs to treat dry eye , an improvement of the ocular surface may in and of itself change the measured rate of tear clearance which could be falsely attributed to the effect of the test drug .\nadditional sources of error in tear film fluorophotometry may arise from reflex lacrimation , changes in tear film thickness , and corneal autofluorescence . with respect to the alternative measures of tear clearance ,\nadditionally , expensive instrumentation is required for quantitation of fluorescein extracted from the polyester rods and color comparison of dyed schirmer strips is complicated by the fact that fluorescein intensity will be affected by the length of strip wetting .\napplicable to all tear clearance methods are anatomical influences ( lid laxity , blink abnormalities , functional tear outflow obstruction ) and optimal timing and dye volume variables . the last point to address\nis the fact that tear turnover measured by any of these tests is not a direct or independent measure of tear production [ 7 , 30 ] . as described by afonso et al .\n, delayed tear clearance occurs in both aqueous tear deficient dry eye as well as \nthis group and others have suggested that tear clearance values may correlate well with ocular irritation symptoms and/or inflammation of the ocular surface [ 7 , 32 ] , but whether or not true measures of production or volume can be made remains to be tested .\nas evidenced by the dews 2007   report , considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the epidemiology , pathophysiology , and diagnosis of dry eye .\nclinically , it appears clear that no single test is capable of repeatedly differentiating dry - eyed from non - dry - eyed individuals . in this review , we have highlighted the fact that although tests such as the schirmer , prt , and fluorophotometry may all be employed to assess clinical endpoints , numerous variables associated with each may contribute to poor test reproducibility and poor correlation to the clinical improvement that accompanies the use of a therapeutic agent .\nalthough unconventional , the prt appears to offer the next best accuracy and reproducibility followed by the schirmer test .\nit is particularly disconcerting that of all these tests , few if any correlate with each other to a significant degree . from the perspective of therapeutic development , these diagnostic shortcomings translate into a significant obstacle as evidenced by the fact that regulatory agency approval of a therapeutic agent that improves both a sign and symptom endpoint has been elusive . due to the limitations of obtaining and measuring select endpoints\nto assess tear function regardless of the test used , it is reasonable to ask if the main reason we do not yet have an approved drug to treat dry eye syndrome is because a given drug simply lacks clinical robustness , or rather , because there are significant quantitative limitations in the methods currently used to demonstrate the clinical robustness of a particular drug ?\nof concern is that regardless of the tear function test used , it appears that none of these tests may ultimately possess the reproducibility , sensitivity , and/or robustness to serve as a reliable and reproducible quantitative assessment of tear volume .\ncontinued efforts in method development will surely be required in order to validate and characterize tear function endpoints used in clinical trials to support the approval of a drug for dry eye therapy ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " the successful development of a therapeutic agent targeting treatment of dry eye syndrome necessitates the demonstration of drug efficacy for both sign and symptom endpoints . as numerous therapeutic strategies incorporate a secretagogue function into their overall mechanism of action , the quantitative assessment of tear production serves as a logical endpoint to anchor \n  sign  efficacy . \n although several methods including the schirmer , the phenol red thread and tear clearance tests exist , their utility in clinical evaluations of novel therapeutics is unclear . \n the purpose of this review is to summarize findings and conclusions describing the performance of each of these tests so as to gain insight into which , if any , is most applicable for use in discovering new dry eye therapeutics .

decreases [ 56 , 57 ] .\nthe analysis of the available literature on the use of rituximab in treating patients with pv is not only difficult but restrictive , as a direct consequence of the significant limitations of the data\n. therefore , interpretation of the data analysis must be done in the light and perspective of these limitations .\non the contrary , these limitations are of significant benefit , because they will help in the design of future studies , and focus on elements of the pharmacodynamics of rituximab therapy .\nsome of these limitations are as follows : the data come from multiple sources ; there is a significant lack of uniformity in the selection of the patients , in defining their severity or extent of disease , and in identifying failed treatment before rituximab ; the lack of an objective scoring system makes changes or responses difficult to evaluate numerically ; the more concerning aspect is the limited follow - up provided by most authors , this becomes an important issue because significant side effects and relapses can occur several months after the discontinuation of rituximab therapy .\nas rituximab is a b cell depletion therapy , many authors have not provided any data on b cell levels and the changes in autoantibody levels .\nnone of the studies provide any rationale or scientific basis for the use of the lymphoma or ra protocols in treating patients with pv .\nthe response of patients to rituximab using the lymphoma protocol or ra protocol has been described in the results section .\nthe total number of patients treated by the lymphoma protocol and its modification was 180 .\nthe length of follow - up for patients in the lymphoma protocol was a mean of 15.44  months ( range 141  months ) and 21.04  months ( range 8.3529  months ) for the ra protocol .\na complete remission occurred in 66.66% of patients on the lymphoma protocol and 75% in the ra protocol .\nthis would suggest that both protocols are effective in producing clinical remissions during an 18-month follow - up . using the lymphoma protocol during this period , 11.11% of these patients are off therapy and 33.33% are on therapy .\nin contrast , in the ra protocol , 53.26% are off therapy and 17.4% are on therapy .\nthis apparent difference is partly due to the fact that the number of patients in whom the presence or absence of therapy while in complete remission is not mentioned in 22.22% of the patients in the lymphoma protocol , but only in 4.34% of the patients in the ra protocol .\ninterestingly , a partial response was observed in 12.78% of patients in the lymphoma protocol , but 23.91% of the patients in the ra protocol .\nof significant interest is the fact that there were no nonresponders in patients treated with the ra protocol compared to 3.9% in the lymphoma protocol .\nthe relapse rates were 22.78% in the lymphoma protocol and 35.87% in the ra protocol .\nthe incidence of serious infections was 3.9% in the lymphoma protocol but 15.21% in the ra protocol .\nthe mortality rate in the lymphoma protocol was 2.22% and 1.09% in the ra protocol .\nit is thus clear that there are significant and remarkable differences in the patient responses between the two protocols .\nthe data analysis did not provide clear indications for specific reasons that may account for these differences .\npreliminary observations would suggest that while the use of the lymphoma protocol produces a lower response rate , there is a lower rate of recurrences and serious infections but a higher mortality rate .\npatients treated by the ra protocol had higher response rates , a larger number of infections , but a lower mortality rate\n. this could be partly due to the fact that more patients were on corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents as concomitant therapy in the lymphoma protocol , thus adding to the degree and duration of prolonged immune suppression . to serve the best interests of the patient\n, it is useful and relevant to determine what purpose the lymphoma and ra protocols serve in their respective diseases .\nthe use of rituximab in lymphoma patients has a duration of response of a median of 12  months ( range 1113.4  months ) after which relapses frequently occur .\na median progression - free survival of 18  months and a 5-year relapse free survival of 28% was reported .\nthe most relevant use of rituximab comes from a 3-year progression - free survival study in which patients were given cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , and prednisone - like chemotherapy with or without rituximab and the 3-year survival rates were 93% and 84% , respectively . therefore , to obtain the benefit of rituximab in lymphoma patients , the addition of other chemotherapeutic agents is required , and can be best measured in 3-year survival rates .\nthe use of rituximab in ra is still a matter of debate and discussion . between 2006 and 2011 , 5,903 patients , who were reported in eight different trials , were treated [ 6168 ] .\nthe benefits of rituximab are measured by the american college of rheumatology s 20% , 50% and 70% improvement criteria [ 6168 ] .\nthe only statistically significant dose regime was two cycles of 1,000  mg of rituximab over 48  weeks that achieved an american college of rheumatology improvement of 20% .\nthe rituximab consensus expert committee in 2011 stated that the optimal treatment paradigms have not yet been defined .\nrecently , two extremely different treatment options have been suggested . in the treatment to target protocol\n, rituximab is given to keep the disease activity score at 2.6 or less whether clinically needed or not .\nhowever , at the present time , there is no protocol that provides prolonged and sustained remission in ra .\ntherefore , it is unclear how many cycles are required to keep patients symptom free , prevent joint destruction , or can be safely given in any defined period .\nfurthermore , ra patients usually receive rituximab with methotrexate concomitantly and often additional prednisone [ 6168 ] .\npv treated by the ra protocol needed multiple infusions to treat recurrent relapses [ 52 , 53 ] .\nthe objectives of treating patients with pv are different from those with lymphoma or ra .\nthe optimal treatment for pv is one in which the disease is controlled , relapses are prevented , and the long - term sustained clinical remission without continued treatment can be achieved . in patients with pv and ocular cicatricial pemphigoid ,\nthis combination of rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin allowed for the discontinuation of previous systemic corticosteroids and isas and produced sustained clinical remissions .\npresently ,

who are nonresponders to conventional therapy.methodsa pubmed search was conducted using the words pemphigus vulgaris and rituximab therapy from papers published between 2000 and 2012 . \n two protocols were used . in the lymphoma protocol , patients received four weekly infusions of rituximab ( dose 375  mg / m2 ) . \n the rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) protocol consisted of two infusions of 1,000  mg each 15  days apart . \n the variables recorded from each study included clinical remission off or on therapy , relapse rate , incidence of serious adverse events , concomitant therapies , duration of follow - up , and when available , levels of b cells and autoantibodies.resultsforty-two studies were found , which reported 272 patients ; 180 were treated by the lymphoma protocol and 92 by the ra protocol . both protocols were effective in treating recalcitrant pv . \n the lymphoma protocol had a lower response rate , relapse rate and serious infections , but higher mortality , and there were nonresponders . \n the ra protocol produced a higher response rate , relapse rate , number of infections , but lower mortality rate , and lacked nonresponders . \n the cumulative follow - up for patients treated with the lymphoma protocol was 15.44  months ( range 141 ) and 21.04  months ( range 8.3529 ) for the ra protocol . \n a major concern in both protocols was the high infection rates , some of which were fatal . \n a different protocol using a combination of rituximab with intravenous immunoglobulin in a defined manner with a definitive endpoint , used in a limited cohort of patients , showed promising results.conclusionneither protocol produced a sustained clinical remission and both required continued systemic therapy . before initiation of treatment \n , physicians should have a specific goal and endpoint and be aware of its potential side effects and lack of information on its long - term effects . \n patients should be carefully monitored during and after therapy .

nonachlordane were significantly higher in ever - smokers than in never - smokers , while male ever - smokers were significantly associated with only pcb 157 , which is a dioxin - like pcb .\nthese results are partially consistent with those of some previous studies . in a study conducted among norwegian women ,\nsmoking was significantly associated with higher levels of pcbs , p , p-dde , and -hch in breast milk .\nalso , a previous small study of a german population ( n  =  80 ) showed that children born to smoking mothers had higher pop concentrations than children of nonsmoking families . on the other hand , some researchers have reported negative associations between pops and smoking . in a short report evaluating the relationship between tobacco smoking and dioxin accumulation in belgium ,\nserum dioxin and coplanar pcbs were lower in current female smokers but higher in current male smokers than in never - smokers .\nthis inconsistency has also been observed in some other studies . while greenland male residents were positively correlated with ocps and plasma cotinine ( ng / ml ) in one study , statistically significant associations with ocps and male\n, we only found significant positive associations between pcbs and male ever - smokers , while no association was observed in women . increased pop concentrations\nmay be associated with enzymes of the p-450 cytochrome oxidase system , including cyp1a1 , cyp1a2 , and phenobarbital - cyp , which metabolize pops , nicotine , and nicotine 's breakdown products .\nconstituents from cigarette smoke , such as cd and co , influence the activity of the enzymes , and cd from cigarettes was reported to stimulate pcb uptake in quail . in our study , the risk of high pop concentrations was lower in the group that smoked 15 cigarettes / day than in the < 15 cigarettes / day group ( table  3 ) . although the difference was not statistically significant , the lower risk of high pop concentrations in heavy smokers ( who smoked more than 15 cigarettes / day ) may be due to the strong stimulation of dioxin biotransformation by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) or other chemicals in cigarette smoke .\nsome studies indicated that the compounds contained in cigarette smoke have affinity for aryl hydrocarbon receptors ( ahr ) and could be potent inducers of cytochrome p450 enzymes .\npops undergo enzymatic hydroxylation , which involves several cytochrome p-450 enzymes to varying extents , and the pops bind to the ahr to upregulate the activity of cyp1a . additionally , cyp2b enzymes metabolize ortho - substituted pcb , including mono - ortho pcb .\nupregulation of these enzymes causes receptor binding that results in an increase in the distribution of pops to the liver from the central compartment .\nin addition , a certain amount of smoking may affect metabolism of pops in the body , and the metabolic ability of pops by smoking may differ by individual . to date , obvious causes of inconsistency in the associations between pops and smoking amount were not revealed . in women , more strong positive associations between pops and smoking were shown than in men .\nthis gender difference may be due to the low metabolic ability of pops in women compared to men . in this study , age ,\nalcohol consumption , and ggt influenced the association between pops and smoking ( etable  3 ) .\nthis could be because age may be one of the major factors of pops accumulation .\nalso , alcohol consumption and ggt levels are related to liver function , so they may affect pops metabolism .\nwe propose that cigarette smoking leads to the bioaccumulation of pops through the action of cytochrome p-450 , one of the hepatic microsomal enzymes .\nhowever , as smoking frequency increases , cytochrome p-450 may trigger some metabolizing action by the pops .\nthese interactions between pops and smoking should be further studied through a large - scale cohort study and through animal experiment .\nfirst , we measured pops concentrations in human samples directly within the korean population rather than using a survey to collect exposure data .\nsecond , we analyzed the relation between serum pops and smoking using smoking amount ( cigarettes / day ) as well as smoking status according to gender .\nthird , 32 pcbs and 19 ocps were analyzed , and associations were observed between a variety of pops and smoking .\nfirst , due to the nature of cross - sectional studies , it is difficult to describe the cause of the relationship between pops and smoking .\nsecond , we could not evaluate female smokers with smoking amount because of the limited sample size .\nthird , self - reported smoking habits may not be accurate , so further studies need to include biological biomarkers , such as cotinine , in order to represent more exact information about smoking habits .\nfurther study to clarify inconsistencies in the relations between pops and smoking amount and gender is needed .\nour results suggest that pop concentrations may be higher in smokers than in never - smokers and that smoking is probably a confounding variable in studies of pops .\nadditional in  vivo and in  vitro experimental studies , as well as larger prospective studies in humans , would help to elucidate the relationship between pops and smoking .\nthis research was supported by grants ( 13162mfds891 and 15162mfds631 ) from the ministry of food and drug safety in 2014 ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " backgroundstudies on the associations between persistent organic pollutants ( pops ) and smoking according to gender and smoking amount ( cigarettes / day ) are limited , and the results regarding the relationship between pops and smoking are not completely consistent across studies.objectivesthe smoking rate in korea is one of the highest among the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) countries . \n we investigated the association between serum concentrations of pops and cigarette smoking in koreans by smoking status ( never -

effective storage are mentioned . in our experience ,\nthe storage of all data is easily possible as long as you are capable of purchasing your storage space cost - effectively without high markup of the pacs vendor because of the dedicated use of the storage space .\nthese requirements are high , but by having a dedicated radiology network segment with a 1-gb / s network speed the storage of the data and review within radiology is not a problem . for 3d processing , the use of a thin - client solution effectively decreases the required network bandwidth and the limitation to series with a maximum of 300 slices of the forward to the enterprise web - server further decreases the required bandwidth outside radiology .\nfurthermore , the transition of pacs viewers from thick to thin client solutions using wavelet compression techniques will further decrease the bandwidth requirements .\nthe advantage of using one pacs storage system that includes all available data with a dedicated and fast network eliminates the requirement for workflow strategies .\nthe value of applying 3d rendering techniques to ct and mri data has been described frequently . although discussion has started on the integration of these techniques into the normal workflow , the main drawback of most current implementations remains that the rendering is performed on dedicated , stand alone , 3d work stations . especially with the arrival of digital reporting , rendering must be integrated into the normal radiological workflow .\nusing this set - up , the availability of thin - slice data sets is transparent to the users .\nbecause all data are stored in one archive permanently and readily available everywhere , only one work station is required for both normal pacs viewing and advanced 3d viewing , and workflow strategies do not have to be implemented ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " current developments in storage solutions , pacs , and client -

trb3 expression increased in the db / db mouse liver promoted blood glucose and increased glucose tolerance .\nwe examined the expression of trb1 , trb2 , and trb3 in the dn mouse kidney and found only trb3 expressed differently between dn and control groups , so trb3 could be a potential cytokine to widen the current knowledge of dn .\nour further study revealed that the mrna and protein levels of trb3 were higher in the dn than normal kidney , which was also positively correlated with tgf-1 protein level and content of collagen .\nprevious study showed that trb3 was positively correlated with kidney tissue fibrosis , which may play a role in promoting the progression of fibrosis by inducing the transformation between epithelial and mesenchymal tissue .\ntherefore , trb3 may be involved in dn by inducing interstitial fibrosis , in which tgf-1 plays a key role .\nwe wondered about the role of trb3 in the fibrosis of dn and the relationship between trb3 and tgf-1 .\nseveral studies supported that trb3 may function as a scaffold protein to control mapk activity [ 10 , 16 , 17 ] . among the several mapk signal pathways ,\nthe erk1/2 pathway is activated under hg in mesangial cells , followed by the complicated synthesis of tgf-1 .\nthe activation of the erk1/2 pathway is necessary for hg - induced production of tgf-1 and connective tissue growth factor ( ctgf ) in mmcs .\ntherefore , we focused on the erk mapk pathway . silencing trb3 decreased erk1/2 activation , followed by decreased mrna and protein levels of tgf-1 and collagen type iv in mmcs , so trb3 may participate in renal fibrosis of dn by upregulating tgf-1 and collagen type iv in mmcs via erk mapk signaling . to our knowledge\n, our study is the first to reveal the interaction between trb3 , erk1/2 , and tgf-1 in renal tissue of dn .\nrecently , trb3 was found stimulated in diabetic kidneys , regulated by the er stress marker chop , and inhibited the podocyte expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 , which first suggested that trb3 plays a protective role in diabetic kidney disease .\nthese findings that differ from our results may be due to cell specificity ; we used mesangial cells , but the previous study used podocytes .\nnumerous cytokines may interact through different pathways , and different signal pathways may have  crosstalk .\nso , the role of trb3 in dn can also be studied from other signal pathways .\ntrb3 plays a role in the pathogenesis of dn by participating in insulin resistance , functioning as a negative modulator of akt [ 9 , 22 , 23 ] .\nanother study showed that trb3 may cause renal cell apoptosis by participating in the nf-b pathway and thus participate in the process of renal fibrosis in dn [ 24 , 25 ] .\nthere must be some interactions between erk , akt , nf-b , smad3 , and other unknown pathways .\nmore detailed and systemic studies are needed to establish the complete theory on trb3 involved in dn . in this study\n, we found that the expression of trb3 increased after blocking the erk1/2 mapk pathway , which may indicate a negative feedback regulation between trb3 and some downstream cytokines of erk1/2 mapk or special \ntrb3 expression is upregulated in renal tissue of dn mice in vivo and mmcs in vitro .\ntrb3 may be involved in dn by regulating the fibrosis cytokine tgf-1 and collagen type iv via erk1/2 mapk signaling ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " to reveal the expression and possible role of tribbles homolog 3 ( trb3 ) in the incidence of type 2 diabetic nephropathy , we used immunohistochemistry , real - time quantitative pcr , western blot analysis , and enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay ( elisa ) to study the expression of trb3 , extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( erk1/2 mapk ) , transforming growth factor 1 ( tgf-1 ) , and collagen type iv in kidneys of db / db diabetic mice and in murine renal mesangial cells stimulated with high glucose . \n the expression of trb3 , tgf-1 , and collagen type iv was increased in kidneys of db / db diabetic mice . \n tgf-1 and collagen type iv regulated by high glucose through erk1/2 mapk were downregulated by silencing trb3 in renal mesangial cells . \n trb3 may be involved in diabetic nephropathy by regulating the fibrosis cytokine tgf-1 and collagen type iv through the erk1/2 mapk signaling pathway .

deterioration in pulmonary function associated with the development of chronic obstructive lung disease ( copd ) is directly related to both the duration of the smoking habit and the number of pack \nyears consumed.1,2 a better understanding of how the smoking habit influences the deterioration in respiratory mechanics would be useful in the precocious diagnosis of copd , which is usually obtained only in the later stages when respiratory function is already impaired . owing to the high prevalence of and medical costs associated with copd ,\nthe precocious identification and treatment of these patients is important in order to avoid the severe and expensive stages of this disease.3   the alterations in respiratory mechanics due to smoking are usually evaluated using respiratory flows and volumes obtained by spirometry .\nhowever , the modifications in respiratory mechanics are not always detected by this test.4 moreover , some patients are not able to perform spirometry reliably , as it requires good subject cooperation and maximal effort.5 the forced oscillation technique ( fot ) offers a simple and detailed approach to investigate the mechanical properties of the respiratory system .\nthis method characterizes the respiratory impedance and its two components , respiratory system resistance ( rrs ) and reactance ( xrs ) .\nthese parameters are usually measured at various frequencies by means of small pressure oscillations ( about 2  cmh2o ) superimposed at the mouth during spontaneous breathing .\nthe method is simple , requires only passive cooperation , and no forced expiratory maneuvers .\nanother important advantage , particularly in pathophysiological research , is that the fot is able to provide information on the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system that are complementary to spirometry.68 the fot was applied successfully by a number of investigators to obtain a detailed analysis of the respiratory mechanics in smokers compared with nonsmokers,4,911 as well as comparisons among nonsmokers , former smokers , and smokers.12 recently , this technique has also been applied successfully in our laboratory in physiological studies of the aging process,13 in the detection of early respiratory changes in smokers,14 as well as in studies conducted in asthmatic15 and sarcoidotic16 patients .\ntherefore , the fot has great potential to increase our knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of smoking , as well as in helping in the clinical diagnosis of respiratory alterations in this disease .\nhowever , to the best of our knowledge , there are no available data using the fot to investigate changes in respiratory impedance in groups with different degrees of tobacco consumption . in this context , the purpose of

diagnostic accuracy of fot and spirometric parameters in groups with different numbers of pack  years .\nthen , the sensitivity and specificity of the fot parameters in identifying respiratory alterations in groups with different numbers of pack  years were analyzed .\nfinally , the diagnostic accuracy of fot parameters was compared with the figures obtained by spirometric volumes and flows

patients with several degrees of tobacco consumption was performed , in a similar way to the work conducted by verbanck et al.17 therefore , healthy control subjects with normal spirometry who had never smoked , as well as smoking subjects who were on no regular medications and had no allergic , respiratory , cardiovascular , gastrointestinal , renal , or neurological symptoms were recruited .\nall subjects had stable health for at least four consecutive weeks and had signed written informed consent .\nbaseline data , including age , height , and weight , were obtained from each subject at the time of the procedures .\nall smokers were current smokers and had been instructed to abstain from smoking for at least 2  h before the testing .\nthe amount of tobacco smoked and the duration of smoking were quantified using the number of pack \nyears , which was calculated by multiplying the mean number of packs ( 20 cigarettes ) consumed daily by the number of years that the subject had their smoking habit.18 the smoking subjects were then stratified into subgroups of < 20 , 2039 , 4059 , and > 60 pack  years .\nsmokers were recruited from both university personnel who smoke and patients who visited the smoking cessation clinic .\nin addition , another 26 patients with documented copd and a smoking history of > 23.5 pack  years were recruited from the outpatient clinic .\ntotal respiratory resistance and reactance were measured using a forced oscillation system as described previously.1921 these measurements were conducted in conformity with the recommendations issued by a task force from the european respiratory society.8 briefly , smallamplitude pressure variations from 4 to 32  hz generated by a loudspeaker were applied at the mouth , using a mouthpiece .\nthe pressure input was measured with a honeywell 176  pc pressure transducer ( honeywell microswitch , boston , ma , usa ) and airway flow with a screen pneumotachograph .\nthe signals were digitized by a personal computer , and their fast fourier transform ( fft ) was computed using blocks of 4,096  points .\nthree measurements were made of 16  s each , and the result of the test was calculated as the mean of these measurements . to perform the fot analysis ,\nthe volunteer remained in a sitting position , keeping the head in a normal position and breathing at functional residual capacity ( frc ) through a mouthpiece . during the measurements , the subjects wore a nose clip and firmly supported their cheeks and submandibular tissue with their hands.8,22,23   the validity of the data was measured by computing the coherence function .\nonly values with a coherence function of 0.9 or more were considered adequate.11,24,25 any time the computed coherence was less than this threshold , the maneuver was not considered valid , and the examination was repeated . whenever adequate coherence measurements could not be obtained according to these criteria , the patient was excluded from the study.16,14,22,23   resistive impedance data were subjected to linear regression analysis over the frequency range of 416  hz .\nthe resistive impedance at 0  hz ( r0 ) was extrapolated from this analysis .\nthis parameter is related to the total resistance of the respiratory system.24 the mean resistance ( rm ) , commonly related to the airway caliber,7 was also calculated for this frequency range .\nadditionally , the slope of the resistive component of the respiratory impedance ( s ) , which is associated with respiratory system homogeneity,12,26 was also obtained from this analysis .\nnegative values of this parameter reflect abnormal patterns of ventilation distribution , which are related to alterations in ventilation  perfusion relationships .\nthe mean reactance ( xm ) , a property usually related to respiratory system nonhomogeneity,27 was calculated based on the entire studied frequency range ( 432  hz ) .\nrespiratory mechanical properties were also characterized by the resonance frequency ( fr ) , which is defined as the frequency at which the xrs equals zero , and the respiratory system dynamic compliance ( crs , dyn ) .\ndynamic compliance reflects the lungs and bronchial wall compliances , the compliance of the chest wall / abdomen compartment , and thoracic gas compression .\nthe time lag between spirometric and fot measurements was always < 15  min . using a closed circuit spirometer\n( vitrace vt139 ; promdico , rio de janeiro , brazil ) , measurements of forced vital capacity ( fvc ) , forced expiratory volume for the first second ( fev1 ) , fev1/fvc , and the ratio of forced expiratory flow ( fef ) between 25% and 75% of fvc to fvc ( fef / fvc ) were obtained for subjects in a sitting position .\nthese parameters were presented as raw data and percentiles of the predicted values ( % ) . predicted values for spirometry were obtained from knudson et al.28 and pereira et al.29 forced expiratory maneuvers were repeated until three sequential measurements were obtained .\nthe indices studied were those obtained through the better curve , which was selected based on the higher value of fev1 plus fvc .\nquality control of spirometry is given by the american thoracic society ( ats ) criteria , with the software allowing the detection of nonacceptable maneuvers .\nthe sample size for this study was calculated using the software medcalc version 8.2 ( medicalc software , mariakerke , belgium ) .\nit was based on an anticipated comparison of means obtained in preliminary studies and an assumption of type i and type ii errors of 5% .\nthe minimal sample size required was 32 subjects per group . in the present study ,\ninitially , univariate and multiple regression analyses were adjusted for pack  years and age and then applied to identify the association of these variables with the fot parameters .\nthe volunteers were then stratified and , when the achieved data presented a statistically normal distribution , the data were reanalyzed using oneway analysis of variance ( anova ) , which was further corrected by the tukey significant difference test . a nonparametric test ( kruskal  wallis ( kw ) ) , associated with a mann  whitney u test , was applied when the data did not present in a normal distribution .\nthe results are presented as meanstandard deviation . a p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant . the performance of the fot indices in the detection of smokinginduced respiratory alterations in the several pack \nyears groups was evaluated by means of receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) analysis.30 these evaluations were constructed using medcalc 8.2 .\ncomparisons of the auc among parameters obtained from fot and spirometry were conducted using medcalc 8.2 , according to the theory described by metz.31 the values of sensitivity , specificity , and area under the curve ( auc ) for spirometry and fot were obtained based on the optimal cutoff point , as determined from the roc curve analysis.30\nin general , the spirometric parameters were highest in normal subjects and decreased significantly as the pack \nunivariate analyses ( table 2 ) show that all the fot parameters presented highly significant correlations with pack  years ( p<0.001 ) .\nyears was highly significant for all the fot parameters ( p<0.001 , table 3 ) .\nin contrast , the contribution of age was only significant for fr , xm and crs , dyn , whereas for r0 , it was not significant , and s and rm were near the limit of significance .\nthe amount of tobacco smoked significantly increased r0 ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , rm ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , and s ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , as seen in figure 1 .\nmean values of r0 and rm increased significantly when groups of normal and smoking subjects of < 20 pack \nthe comparisons between adjacent groups were statistically significant only for r0 when comparing the two highest pack \ns was not statistically significant when comparing the control with the < 20 or 2039 pack \nyears groups , but was significantly increased in comparison with the two highest pack  years groups ( p<0.001 ) . as the amount of tobacco smoked increased , crs , dyn ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) and xm ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) were significantly reduced , whereas fr ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) was increased ( figure 2 ) .\nthe differences comparing the control group with the < 20 and 2039 pack  years groups were not significant for fr and xm ( figure 2a and b ) .\nin contrast , the same comparisons resulted in significant reductions in crs , dyn ( figure 2c ) .\nconsidering the comparisons between adjacent classes , significant modifications were observed between the two highest pack  years groups in all three of the reactive parameters studied .\nfigure 3 presents the roc curves for fot and spirometric parameters in all the studied groups .\nthe performance of the fot and spirometric indices in the detection of smokinginduced respiratory alterations is described in figure 4 .\ntable 4 shows detailed values of area under the roc curve ( auc ) , sensitivity , and specificity for the optimal cutoff point for the fot indices .\nthe results of the comparative analysis among the auc of fot and spirometric parameters are described in figure 5 . in general , r0 ( figure 5a ) , rm ( figure 5c ) , and crs , dyn ( figure 5e ) presented significantly higher auc in smoking subjects with < 20 pack \nyears , and auc similar to that presented by spirometric parameters as the amount of tobacco smoked increased .\nspirometric parameters presented significantly higher auc than s ( figure 5b ) , fr ( figure 5d ) , and xm ( figure 5f ) considering groups of smoking subjects with 2039 pack  years and 4059 pack  years .\nthis study documented a significantly deleterious effect of smoking on the impedance of the respiratory system .\nalthough many other published reports have used the fot to compare control groups with exsmokers and/or smoking subjects , to the best of our knowledge , this study is the first study to investigate respiratory impedance in groups with different degrees of tobacco consumption .\nthe present study supports these results and also shows that these modifications are proportional to the number of pack  years the subjects smoked . in agreement with earlier studies,18,32 we found that the spirometric parameters decreased as the pack \nyears , had significant differences in age ( table 1 ) , which is expected because the increase in pack  years demands time for exposure . in the present study , we found that univariate analysis ( table 2 ) showed a higher relationship between the fot parameters and pack  years ( mean r  =  0.28 ) than between the fot parameters and age ( mean r  =  0.13 ) .\nin fact , age was not significantly related to the resistive fot parameters ( table 3 ) , whereas in the reactive parameters , the contributions of age were similar to pack \nyears in fr and xm , and negligible in csr , dyn . comparing r in univariate ( table 2 ) and multivariate analysis ( table 3 )\nthe significant increase in r0 ( figure 1a , kwanova , p<0.0001 ) and the moderate ( r  =  0.34 ) , but significant ( p<0.001 ) , correlation with pack \nsmoking leads to a series of bronchial modifications that are consistent with these results , including edema , inflammation in the mucosa , and hypertrophy of the mucosal glands , resulting in hypersecretion of mucus .\nhypertrophy of smooth muscle and fibrosis of the bronchial wall are two additional factors that can contribute to elevations in both airway and tissue resistances . increased r0 values for smoking subjects have been reported before.4,1012 the increase in r0 with pack  years can be explained given that modifications resulting from smoking begin in the small , peripheral airways , where large increases in resistance do not significantly increase total resistance .\nsignificant differences were observed comparing the control and the < 20 and 2039 pack  years groups .\nthis suggests that r0 values could be useful in detecting initial airway obstructions that are associated with smoking .\nmean resistance ( rm ) is associated with the caliber of the central airways.7 therefore , obstruction of these airways could explain the increases in rm values ( figure 1b ) , which could be related to inflammatory alterations.2 more specifically , rm increased significantly with pack \nyears ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) , showing a significant ( p<0.001 ) relationship , which would explain 24% of the variance in this index .\nin contrast , we found significant differences between the control group and the smoking groups , even with the fewest pack \nalthough lndsr and colleagues9 and hayes and colleagues10 reported a small , but not significant , difference comparing values of nonsmokers with smokers , significant differences were reported by brochard and colleagues11 in similar studies conducted among nonsmokers , exsmokers , and smokers .\nfigure 1c shows that the respiratory system of the smoking subjects became more inhomogeneous with increasing pack \nyears . the significant modification in s ( kwanova , p<0.0001 ) had moderate ( r  =  0.36 ) and significant ( p<0.0001 ) correlation with pack  years , which links increased tobacco consumption with decreased respiratory system homogeneity .\nit was not statistically possible to separate the mean s values of the control group from those of the < 20 and 2039 pack \nyears groups . on the other hand , comparisons between the control group and the 4059 and > 60 pack \nyears groups displayed significant differences ( p<0.006 ) , often associated with the more pronounced mechanical modifications present in these groups .\nsignificant differences between adjacent groups can be found when comparing the groups with higher tobacco consumption .\nthe shunt impedance of the upper airway walls , which are mechanically in parallel with the respiratory system , introduces an error that is expected to be large in obstructed patients33 and results in artifactual frequency dependence on the rrs values .\ntherefore , besides respiratory system nonhomogeneity , the upper airway wall shunt probably affects the results described in figure 1c . in the studied groups ,\nyears of tobacco smoking were significantly associated with a decline in crs , dyn ( figure 2a , kwanova , p<0.0001 ; r  =  0.37 , p<0.0001 ) .\ninterestingly , a highly significant decrease could already be noted comparing the control and the < 20 pack  years groups .\nin contrast to these results , hayes and colleagues10 found no differences when comparing the crs , dyn in nonsmokers and asymptotic smokers with normal spirometry . a reduction in crs , dyn values reflects a change in pulmonary tissue , chest wall , modification of the distensibility of the airways,7 and/or an increase in airway resistance.34 therefore\n, the reduction in the crs , dyn value observed in the smokers could be associated with a progressive increase in peripheral airway resistance or a reduction in respiratory system compliance .\nthere are always highly significant statistical differences in the comparisons between nonsmoking and smoking groups , which suggests the usefulness of crs , dyn as a sensitive index of smoking effects . increasing tobacco use in the studied groups\nwas associated with an increase in fr ( figure 2b ; kwanova , p<0.0001 ; r  =  0.50 , p<0.0001 ) . the comparisons of fr values between control and smoking groups\nthis suggests that fr is not useful as an index for the initial effects of smoking .\nyears in the different groups studied resulted in decreased xm mean values ( figure 2c ; kwanova , p<0.0001 ) . the significant inverse correlation between xm and pack  years ( r  =  0.57 , p<0.0001 ) reflects the impact of smoking on the reduction in respiratory system homogeneity and dynamic compliance of the studied subjects . comparing the control and smoking groups , statistically significant modifications were only observed between the control and the 4059 pack \nthese results suggest that xm might be useful in detecting the respiratory effects of smoking , predominantly in the more advanced stages .\nit must be pointed out that the results presented here need to be interpreted with caution . as several of the subjects studied\nwere recruited from the university hospital smoking cessation and outpatient clinics , these results can probably be limited to describe this population .\nrecently , the national heart , lung and blood institute recommended that research on new technologies to improve noninvasive tests of lung function in copd should be a priority.35 the fot was suggested by crapo et al.5 as an attractive alternative for diagnosing obstruction in copd , as it requires little patient effort and cooperation .\ncosio and colleagues36 pointed out that the pathological changes induced by tobacco use were still potentially reversible up to 770 cigarettes / day  years smoked ( 38.5 pack \nour results comparing r0 , rm , and crs , dyn in the group with < 20 pack \nyears ( mean  =  7.35.4 pack  years ) and the group with 2039 pack  years ( mean  =  29.35.6 pack  years ) suggest that small abnormalities exist prior to 38.5 pack \nyears ( figures 1 and 2 ) and that fot could be useful in detecting the effects of smoking , while they are still potentially reversible . in order to investigate this possibility ,\nroc curves were elaborated . according to the literature , roc curves with aucs between 0.50 and 0.70\nindicate low diagnostic accuracy , aucs between 0.70 and 0.90 indicate moderate accuracy , and aucs between 0.90 and 1.00 indicate high accuracy.30,37 an auc > 0.80 is usually considered adequate for clinical use.30,37 thus , s , xm , and fr reached acceptable values for clinical use only in the group with the higher duration of the smoking habit ( figures 3 and 4 , table 4 ) .\nin contrast , auc values for r0 , rm , and crs , dyn near to those considered for high accuracy measurements were obtained for the 2039 pack \nyears group ( figures 3 and 4 , table 4 ) . in this condition ,\nrm was the most adequate to correctly identify the effects of smoking , with a sensitivity of 82.4% and a specificity of 85.3% . as expected , because of the smaller alterations in respiratory mechanics , the < 20 pack \nyears group showed reduced auc values ( figures 3 and 4 , table 4 ) . even in this adverse situation , r0 and rm were able to obtain auc values considered adequate for clinical use , while crs , dyn reached the limit value ( 0.78 ) . among all the studied parameters , r0 was the best , showing a sensitivity of 73.5% and a specificity of 73.5% .\nthese promising results suggest that the fot may be useful in prevention of the adverse effects of the smoking habit , noninvasively detecting early smokinginduced respiratory abnormalities while the pathologic changes are still potentially reversible .\nthis also suggests that the fot may be useful as a screening tool in the management of smokinginduced lung disease .\ndifference in auc has become one of the most commonly used measures for comparing the performance of two diagnostic systems.38 according to metz,31 when we have a number of roc curves to compare , the auc is usually the best discriminator . in smoking subjects with < 20 pack  years , this analysis was clearly in favor of r0 and rm ( figure 5a and c ) .\nthe diagnostic accuracy of crs , dyn was higher than all the spirometric parameters , except fef2575% ( figure 5e ) .\nthere were no statistically significant differences in auc considering xm , fr , and s and the spirometric parameters ( figure 5b , d and f ) .\nthis suggests that r0 , rm , and crs , dyn values could be more useful than spirometric parameters in detecting early changes associated with smoking .\nthe results obtained in the present study considering patients with 2039 pack  years show that the area under the roc curve was significantly larger for r0 , rm , and crs , dyn than for fev1(% ) and fev1(l ) ( figure 5a , c and e ) .\non the other hand , several spirometric parameters presented significantly higher auc values than s , fr , and xm ( figure 5b , d and f ) .\noostven et al.,8 suggested that , in general , the clinical diagnostic capacity of respiratory impedance measurement by the fot is comparable to that of spirometry . in line with this hypothesis ,\nthe comparison of diagnostic accuracy of the fot and spirometric parameters in the group of patients with 4059 pack  years revealed similar performances of r0 , rm , and crs , dyn and spirometric parameters ( figure 5a , c and e ) .\nthe majority of the parameters obtained by spirometric measurements were significantly more accurate than s , fr , and xm ( figure 5b , d and f ) , which suggests that r0 , rm , and crs , dyn are as useful as spirometry , and that spirometric parameters are more adequate than s , fr , and xm as indices of smoking effects in this range of pack  years .\nthe spirometric parameters fev1(% ) and fev1(l ) are standard measures of lung function commonly used in the evaluation of patients with copd.39 the diagnostic performance of r0 ( figure 5a ) and crs , dyn ( figure 5e ) was significantly higher than that of fev1(% ) and fev1(l ) , and similar to that presented by other spirometric parameters in smoking subjects with > 60 pack \nrm and s showed accuracies similar to those presented by the spirometric parameters ( figure 5b and c ) . in general , fr and xm were less accurate than spirometric parameters ( figure 5d and f ) .\nspirometric measurements require good cooperation , are also effort dependent , and can lead to temporary alterations in bronchomotor tone due to the deep inspiration required , which can have implications for respiratory mechanics measurements . in contrast , the fot is easy to perform , requires minimal cooperation from the patient , and no respiratory maneuvers are needed .\nthese practical considerations , together with the results of the present study , indicate that r0 , crs , dyn , rm , and s may be added to other conventional examinations to help with the clinical evaluation of patients with copd who are not able to adequately perform spirometric measurements . in conclusion ,\nthe smoking habit resulted in changes in respiratory mechanics that were proportional to pack  years .\nthe fot provided resistive and reactive parameters that were in close agreement with the involved pathophysiology .\nan important increase in respiratory system resistance and a reduction in dynamic compliance were observed in all the groups studied .\naccordingly , the parameters with the highest sensitivity and specificity for identifying smoking patients were r0 , rm , and crs , dyn . even in the group with the smallest alterations ( < 20 pack \nyears ) , r0 and rm were able to obtain auc values considered adequate for clinical use .\nour data demonstrated that the fot might be useful for early detection of obstructive disease related to the smoking habit , which agrees with the literature consensus that the mechanical modifications resulting from smoking should be detected as early as possible in order to advise smoking cessation .\nthe comparison of the diagnostic accuracy of the fot and spirometric parameters indicated that r0 , rm , and crs , dyn were more accurate than spirometric indices in diagnosing smaller alterations ( < 20 pack \nthese parameters presented diagnostic performance similar to the spirometric parameters in groups with higher pack  years .\nthese results suggest that the fot can be proposed as a complementary method to detect the harmful effects of smoking while they are still potentially reversible , contributing to copd prevention , diagnosis , and treatment .\nthe brazilian council for scientific and technological development ( cnpq ) and the rio de janeiro state research supporting foundation ( faperj ) supported this study ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " introduction : detection of smoking effects is of utmost importance in the prevention of cigaretteinduced chronic airway

axis , which suggests that the presumption that the mammary line is a pre - existing structure from which the mammary glands subsequently derive by a shared mechanism , is incorrect , at least for mice . moreover , defects in the formation and morphogenesis of select mammary gland pairs in various genetically modified mice show that different signaling networks induce and maintain mammary gland development at different positions along the ap - axis .\nfurthermore , the reciprocal tissue interactions governing mammary gland development   may co - vary with the high internal left - right ( lr ) asymmetry of the trunk .\nindeed , lr - asymmetry between counterparts of mammary gland pairs has also become evident .\nfuture studies on normal and pathological mammary gland development will benefit greatly from consistent documentation and analysis of data relative to mammary gland position .\naccordingly , we will refer to them by number 110 , as opposed to pair ( 15 ) or position ( fig\n.  1 ) , unless the cited literature refers to mammary glands as clusters ( e.g. anterior , posterior ) without explicit specification of which glands were subject to examination .\nthe 2:1 correlation between the number of mammary glands and average litter size in most species   and co -

type embryos of mixed genetic backgrounds but persists in some nrg3 mutants , showing that mammogenic potential also exists at atypical positions outside the line .\nthe various mesenchymal inductive mechanisms seem to converge on shared epithelial regulators , whose extent of activation appears to regulate the number of induced mrs .\nit is conceivable then that the variable inductive signals bestow the mr cells with unique properties . indeed\n, preliminary gene profiling data suggest that each of the five paired mammary placode epithelia express unique subsets of genes ( sun and veltmaat , http://www.veltmaatlab.net/research.html ) . while the functional relevance of these genes remains to be determined , mammary development proceeds differently in all mrs , as evidenced by the different growth rate and morphogenesis of the mrs , culminating in rudimentary glandular trees before birth that differ in size and number of branches ( fig .  2 ) .\nthese differences may very well underlie some of the differential attributes of adult mgs ( discussed below).fig .\nimages of all mammary rudiments of a carmine -

right counterparts of a pair have no mirror - imaged symmetric morphology .\nmg : mammary gland ; hf : hair follicle why do mesodermal genes act differently at different positions along the mammary line ?\nthe answer may be found in their expression pattern , which is in part reflected in the temporal development of the murine mammary line .\nthis line is actually composed of three initially unconnected streaks of wnt10b expression . as concluded from the phenotypes summarized in table  1 , these streaks form independently of each other . the first streak forms on the flank , between the limbs . its initially fragmented wnt10b expression pattern in wild - type embryos ( fig .  1 ) and\ndorsalized position upon hypaxial truncation of the somites , as in pax3 null mutants , indicate somitic involvement in the formation of this streak .\nfgf10 is expressed highly in the hypaxial dermomyotomal tips of somites # 1218 , which underlie the region where mr2/7 and mr3/8 form [ 14 , 15 ] .\npartial reduction of somitic fgf10 expression , as in gli3 null or hypomorphic fgf10 mutants , allows formation of a mammary line and all mrs except mr3/8 , indicating that at least this pair requires somitic fgf10 and , contrary to mr2/7 , is susceptible to reduced levels of fgf10 .\nfgf10 is not expressed in somites 1924 , and neither wnt10b expression in this region nor induction of mr4/9 ( above # 24 somites ) requires fgf10/fgfr2b signaling .\nthese observations suggest that the anterior and posterior regions of this streak are two separate entities which develop by independent mechanisms , and that another yet to be identified somitic molecule(s ) may be responsible for the initiation of mammogenesis in the posterior region , at the posterior edge of which arises mr4 or mr9 .\ninterestingly , the boundary between the fgf10-dependent and fgf10-independent region at the level of # 18 somites is home to a small mesenchymal nrg3 expression domain , which seems a prerequisite for normal formation of mr3/8 .\nthe two other mammary streaks are located in the axilla and inguen , where they give rise to mr1/6 and mr5/10 , respectively .\ndefects in these streaks or their mrs often coincide with defects in limb induction or specification in the absence of limb mesenchymal factors like tbx2 , tbx3 , gli3 and fgf10 [ 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 ] .\nit remains to be determined whether mr1/6 and mr5/10 require such factors or the limb mesenchyme directly , or indirectly via formation of the limbs as new signaling centers .\nperhaps mr2/7 , that form at the junction of the first and axillary streak , and depend less than mr3/8 on somitic signals , similarly benefit from signals that originate in the limb . in conclusion ,\nmrs develop due to in part variable mesodermal inductive signals along the ap - axis that converge on common ectodermal executive pathways .\nthus , the different glands experience unique developmental histories and , furthermore , are embedded and surrounded by tissue that exhibits region - specific properties .\nthe embryonic flanks develop in the trunk as two broad lateral regions where the dorsal paraxial mesoderm intermingles with the ventral lateral plate mesoderm ( lpm ) .\nthey establish new , ventro - lateral boundaries with the ventrum , which serve as bilateral platforms for mammary line formation .\nexternally , these presumptive mammary forming regions look left - right ( lr ) symmetric . but looks can be deceiving !\nlr asymmetries during mammogenesis become evident at the level of individual mammary gland pairs : the size and branching pattern differ between contralateral glands ; one counterpart of a normal or supernumerary pair may be missing or shifted from its symmetric position , shown for mouse in figs .  2 and 3 .\nin humans with poland syndrome , one breast ( most often the right ) may remain hypoplastic .\ninterestingly , formation of the mammary line and mrs is slightly advanced on the left side ( fig .  3 ) and the left side seems to have a greater mammogenic potential . for example ,\nunilateral polythelia or polymastia occurs most frequently on the left side in humans   and mice .fig .\nimages of flanks of lac - z stained mice ( mixed genetic backgrounds ) expressing topgal as a marker for mammary line and rudiment formation .\ntop four panels show left - right asynchrony in formation of the mammary line and mammary rudiment ( mr ) pair 2 and 7 .\nlower four panels show anterior shift of mr 8 and formation of supernumerary mrs ( indicated as 3 and 4 near the normal mr3 and mr4 ) examples of left -

right asynchrony in formation of the mammary line and mammary rudiment ( mr ) pair 2 and 7 .\nlower four panels show anterior shift of mr 8 and formation of supernumerary mrs ( indicated as 3 and 4 near the normal mr3 and mr4 ) the basis for lr asymmetric mammary gland development is likely rooted in embryonic lr patterning : during vertebrate embryogenesis , the lr axis establishes the positions of the heart and visceral organs and promotes structural asymmetries that are necessary for their functions .\nthe driving force for lr patterning is unilateral activity of molecules such as the secreted factor nodal , which is expressed by the left half of the node , left - sided lpm and overlying ectoderm . in the left - sided lpm\n, nodal initiates the expression of the transcription factor pitx2 , an essential  interpreter  of lr axial patterning during organogenesis [ reviewed by 23 ] .\nthus , as ectodermal appendages that are induced at the ventro - lateral boundaries , i.e. at the fronts of somitic penetration into two molecularly different regions of left and right lpm , the left and right mammary glands have distinct molecular  histories  from their inception ! moreover , and despite their morphological bilateral symmetry , the left and right somites also differ from each other with significant lr differences in gene expression [ 24 , 25 ] . of interest\nis perhaps heparin - binding egf - like growth factor , which is transiently elevated on the left side , temporally overlapping with formation of mr3/8 .\nfurthermore , retinoic acid ( ra ) signaling promotes lr asymmetry in the somites , as demonstrated by one - sided delay in somite formation in chick and zebrafish embryos , caused by pharmacological inhibition of ra production [ 26 , 27 ] .\nseveral modulators of ra signaling and synthesis , including raldh2 , are expressed in the somites proper , and the ra receptor rar is expressed in the flank mesenchyme underlying mr2/7 , 3/8 , 4/9 .\nunfortunately , laterality in effects of ra signaling on mammary gland development was not tested .\nthis will be difficult to do , due to lethality of ra - deprived mouse models prior to mammary gland formation , and due to artifacts introduced during mr development ex vivo under otherwise normal conditions , but especially under experimental conditions such as pharmological modulation of ra - signaling .\nhowever , it is of interest that ra - deficient raldh2 mouse embryos exhibit transiently delayed right - sided development and segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm into somites # 815 . with mr2/7 and mr3/8 forming above the # 12 and # 15 somites respectively ,\nit is thus conceivable that ra signaling may be a pivotal link between somitic laterality and asynchrony and asymmetry in development of lr counterparts of particularly these mr pairs .\nmoreover , the already known requirement of somitic signals for induction of mr3/8 , provides strong support for the hypothesis that this mammary gland pair  despite its seemingly morphological symmetry - may be lateralized , either directly or indirectly via inductive interaction with lateralized aspects of somites , including effects of ra - signaling .\nfinally , the curvature of the ap - body axis may also be involved in promoting subtle asymmetry of mammogenesis : most often the ap - axis is curved to the right ( tail over right shoulder ) , leading to a \nif molecular gradients are involved in early mammary gland formation , which is the case at least for somitic fgf10 , their shape may be different between left and right flanks , which could possibly explain the slight lr asynchrony in length of the mammary lines and mis - alignment between paired glands that is sometimes observed even in wild - type embryos ( fig . \na striking but still unexplained feature of breast cancer is a higher tumor incidence in the left breast .\nalthough modest with a ~1.10 left / right incidence ratio , such laterality was consistently found in several epidemiological studies [ 3036 ] regardless of gender and stage of disease . even in bilateral breast cancer cases ,\nsurvival rates also appear to reflect lr differences : a breast cancer study among 590 russian patients reported a statistically significant higher survival rate of patients with right - sided , advanced stage disease .\nin contrast , a study of 163 norwegian patients associated longer survival with left - sided disease , but did not relate this finding to disease stage . in a third study of 10,702 israeli women , no laterality was detected for overall patient survival from years 115 , but trends of a higher 510  year survival rate of left - sided later stage disease , and a higher 1015  year survival rate of right - sided early stage disease , call for statistical analysis of the data within such smaller time periods , which had not been done .\nthe most recent study of 384 pakistani breast cancer patients indicates that although left - sided tumors are larger and more prevalent , when standardized for tumor size , right - sided tumors are more prone to metastasis and are associated with lower survival rates .\nalthough the results of these studies appear discordant with each other , they certainly attest to the need for well - defined parameters to better assess laterality .\nfurthermore , these available data contest , at least in part , the assumption that asymmetry in survival may be due to radiation - induced heart damage , which is greater with left - side targeted therapy . instead , the data suggest that the lr differences may be due to lateralized tumor biology , similar to lr asymmetry in incidence and patient survival observed with cancers of other paired organs , including kidney cancer , which does not entail cardiac complications following side - specific radiation therapy [ 33 , 41 ]\n. why do tumors form with unequal probability and perhaps outcome in left versus right members of organ pairs ?\na variety of epidemiological correlates have been investigated , including age , race , ethnicity , sex , breast size , stage of disease at diagnosis , histological tumor type , and even left- versus right - handedness .\nnone of these factors emerged as a consistently significant variable for the increased left - sided incidence [ 3032 , 37 ] .\nby contrast , laterality in outcome may in part be explained by laterality of axillary lymph node metastasis .\na higher mean number of lymph nodes with metastases in breast cancer patients has been reported for right - sided tumors , consistent with more lymph nodes present on the right side [ 43 , 44 ] . however , when axillary lymph node involvement was analyzed with respect to the total number of affected nodes , the right - sided increase was present only in patients with 13 positive nodes . for patients with >\n3 positive nodes ( a characteristic of locally advanced or higher stage disease ) left - sided tumors were associated with more affected nodes despite the lr asymmetry in overall node number .\nthus , metastasis to lymph nodes seems to be a lateralized disease feature , and may indicate lr differences in tumor biology , e.g. greater metastatic potential of left - sided tumors , or lateralized features of the lymph nodes themselves .\nin general , attempts to identify lateralized features may be confounded by the profound heterogeneity of breast cancer and could possibly be improved by inclusion of more detailed cancer subtype - specific information such as genomic classifiers . indeed , an interesting correlate in laterality of breast tumors is the expression of her-2 and perhaps also hormone receptors , although the sidedness may co - vary with other parameters : among 166 kuwaiti patients spanning all disease stages at diagnosis , right - sided tumors are significantly associated with amplified her-2 expression , without lateralized differences for hormone receptor expression , whereas among 384 pakistani breast cancer patients with bone metastasis , right - sided tumors were markedly less prone to express her-2 , estrogen receptor , or progesterone receptor , either individually or in combination .\nit is tempting to speculate that the lr differences in tumor incidence and patient survival may be related to expression of genes that govern lr axial patterning during embryonic development , like nodal and pitx2 [ reviewed by 47 ] . increased expression of nodal and methylation of pitx2 dna correlates with poor prognostic outcome in breast cancer patients [ 4850 ] .\noverexpression of another nodal pathway component , the co - receptor cripto-1 , is also associated with decreased patient survival [ reviewed by 49 ] .\nconsistent with these findings , nodal pathway signaling promotes an invasive phenotype in breast cancer cells and induces tumor vascularization , which has implications for disease progression and relapse .\nwhether nodal or nodal pathway members are expressed asymmetrically during mammary gland development remains to be investigated , as does the question of whether such putative lr differences are recapitulated in breast tumors .\nwhile the laterality in breast cancer incidence and outcome seems subtle , evidence for its existence is compelling\n. we may be unaware of more significant aspects of laterality because situs is often not a factor in molecular and clinical correlations , and experimental data in mouse models typically are generated from a single side , or if from both sides , may be combined for analyses , obscuring potential lr differences .\nto our knowledge , laterality has not been investigated systematically in any mouse tumor mammary model to date .\nbetter insights into laterality of breast cancer incidence , biology , and outcome may lead to a better understanding of the disease(s ) and have prognostic value .\nthe axial position of the human breast approximates the 5th thoracic somite or its derived rib . taking into account the differences in somite number between mouse and human\n, this area corresponds best to the area between mg2/7 and 3/8 in the mouse .\nas described above , the five pairs of mammary glands in the mouse are each induced by unique inductive signaling networks . yet surprisingly little information exists on differences between the five pairs of glands in adult mice , both at the level of normal physiology and with respect to response to tumor - initiating events\n. however , several studies report significantly differential tumor incidence or biology depending on the position along the ap axis .\nso the answer is almost certainly : yes ! examples for ap variations in tumor - incidence and biology come from endogenous tumor agents , chemical carcinogenesis , various treatments , and transgenic approaches .\nintegration of mouse mammary tumor viruses ( mmtv ) in the c3h mouse strain causes mammary tumors most often in thoracic glands . while tumor incidences are equal among the gland pairs after correction for total wet tissue weight , the relative ratios of epithelial to stromal / adipose tissue may not correspond to wet weights and could confound the analysis\nindeed , increased incidence of dmba - induced tumors in the thoracic mammary glands of rats was correlated to asynchronous development of the glands .\ndifferences in the number of terminal end buds ( tebs ) and alveolar buds per gland results in variable abundance of target cells for chemical carcinogens depending on treatment age .\nlikewise , murine mg2/7 and mg3/8 exhibit a greater number and larger tebs than mg4/9 ( see also fig . \n2 ) ; and mg2/7 specifically undergoes a reduction in tebs from 5 to 6  weeks of age .\nthese ap - specific developmental features are a plausible basis for increased tumor incidence in thoracic glands .\ninterestingly , exposure to power frequency magnetic fields ( mf ) increases dmba - induced mammary tumorigenesis in sd1 rats , particularly of mg1/6 and 2/7 in correlation with more significant mf - induced increases in ornithine decarboxylase activity  a possible indicator for stem cell proliferation .\nhowever , in f433 fisher rats , mf exposure increased the incidence of dmba - induced adenocarcinoma specifically in the 5th of the six pairs of glands in rats , but latency was reduced most in the 3rd pair .\nthus , region - specific effects on tumorigenesis may vary even between strains of the same species .\ntransgenic mmtv - polyoma middle t antigen ( pymt ) causes the largest tumor burden with shortest latency in mg1/6 of c57bl/6 mice .\ntumor latency is more similar among all other glands , with mg4/9 harboring the second largest tumor burden .\nintroduction of an inos ( nos2 ) null mutation increases tumor latency and reduces tumor burden most in mg4/9 and least in mg1/6 .\noverexpressed erbb2 in mmtv - cneu mice   induces tumors preferentially in mg2/7  +  3/8 ( table  2 ) and tumor incidence is comparatively low in mg4/9/5/10 .\ntransgenic c3(1)-sv40-t / t - antigen causes tumor formation first in mg1/6 and mg2/7 with the highest total tumor burden in mg2/7 .\ndifferential activity of transgene promoters is one possible explanation for variations in transgene - initiated mammary tumorigenesis .\neven then , such mechanism(s ) would serve to highlight the significance of biological differences between pairs of glands .\nwhat is clear from these data , though , is that these transgenic models generate most tumors in specific anterior mammary glands , raising the question if other transgenic models exhibit similar or other unique gland - specific incidences along the ap-axis.table 2regional distribution of mammary tumors in mmtv - cneu transgenic micecohort \\ glandsmg1/6mg2/7 + 3/8mg4/9 + 5/10a4 ( 15)19 ( 73)**3 ( 12)b11 ( 27)26 ( 63)**4 ( 10)weight ( % ) ( 18)(46)(36)(a ) number of palpable tumors observed in 21 tumor -

effects poisson regression analysis transplantation experiments also provide clues to the existence of ap - axial effects both in the tumor cells and environment .\npymt tumor cells isolated from anterior tumors proliferate faster than cells from posterior tumors , independent of implantation site .\nsignificant differences in gene expression exist between anterior and posterior tumors despite equivalent histology , and the difference in proliferative potential was maintained over transplantation passages .\nmoreover , the higher take rate of teratocarcinoma cell grafts at lumbar subcutaneous sites despite their faster growth rate at thoracic sites   provides evidence for unique positional features .\nlikewise , mda - mb-435 tumor cell xenografts in thoracic mfps grow better in response to high fat diet but not when in inguinal mfps . thus , along the ap - axis , both the mammary epithelium and stroma harbor positional variations that influence tumor growth .\nfinally , modality of disease progression may also depend on positional differences : tumors of c3hxvy - avy mice are more likely to metastasize from thoracic glands than from abdominal glands .\nmda - mb-435 cell implants into mfps of athymic nude mice showed the same tendency and moreover , thoracic implants spread via the vascular system , while inguinal implants spread via the lymphatic system .\na comprehensive review article on wound healing , immune responsiveness , and mammary tumorigenesis in mice and rats , concluded that not only tumor growth , but also wound healing responses are more pronounced in anterior regions\n. the prominent role of inflammatory signaling in breast cancer suggests that this ap - gradient may influence murine mammary tumor biology .\nthe ap - gradient of the nervous system and vascularization , resulting in reduced blood flow in the posterior body , provides perhaps the likeliest explanation for the region - specific variations in tumor biology .\nsuch a gradient has also been confirmed for blood flow in pectoral versus inguinal mammary glands .\nconsequently , one can hypothesize that posterior glands exhibit reduced oxygen tension and lower concentrations of systemic factors , which may modulate tumor incidence .\nalternatively , varying relative positions of lymph nodes may alter lymph drainage of the tissue and consequently tumor biology .\nthe role of embryonic signaling pathways in promoting cancer cell stemness and metastasis   may suggest that differential intrinsic features of tumor cells and their microenvironment could possibly be traced back to the differential developmental signals along the mammary line of the mouse .\nfor example , by interpretation of regional cues , hox transcription factors lay down positional memory that results in region - of - origin specific cell biology , as shown for dermal fibroblasts . by analogy\n, mammary stroma may secrete unique factors depending on their position along the ap axis .\naberrant hox gene activity has also been implicated in breast cancer   and in altered wnt signaling [ 69 , 70 ] .\ngiven the prominent role of the wnt pathway in embryonic mg development and in breast tumor biology , it is conceivable that the hox and wnt pathways affect tumors differentially along the ap axis .\nthe mouse is an invaluable model system to study mammalian development , physiology and cancer . here , we reviewed evidence that each of the ten mammary glands in mouse is unique , from inception to maintenance , throughout normal and tumor development as well as metastasis .\nmechanistic insights into causes for variations in prenatal development of the mammary glands begin to emerge .\none can presently only speculate about the cause(s ) for regional variations in tumor incidence and biology , which may in part stem from intrinsic molecular differences during embryogenesis , and from variations in stromal factors including vascularization and lymph drainage .\nhowever , this phenomenon can possibly be exploited to gain insights into factors that modulate tumorigenesis .\nclearly , future studies on normal and pathological mammary gland development will benefit greatly from improved documentation of positional variations .\nin particular , laterality should be treated as a possible variable in studies of human patients to discern why tumor incidence and progression are lateralized disease features and to assess the potential implications for the clinic .\ninbred mouse strains and engineered mouse models provide unique opportunities to study positional variations from both left - right and anterior - posterior axis effects .\ninvaluable information may be lost when samples / data from different locations are combined before analyses , or confounded when phenotypic aspects of one gland are correlated to molecular data from another . moreover\n, experimental design and analysis of specific cancer models may improve when regional effects are taken into account , e.g. by tailoring treatments to developmental asynchrony and by making guided choices such as using inguinal glands for studies of lymphatic metastasis .\nultimately , such consideration of positional variations in mammary gland development and tumorigenesis should improve the predictive value of studies in mouse for various aspects of human breast cancer ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " most mammals develop their mammary glands in pairs of which the two counterparts are symmetrically displaced away from the ventral midline . based on this symmetry and the same functional outcome as a milk - producing organ , the mammary glands are easily presumed to be mere copies of one another . based on our analysis \n of published data with inclusion of new results related to mammary development and pathology in mice , we argue that this presumption is incorrect : between and within pairs , mammary glands differ from one another , and tumor incidence and biology depend on the position along the anterior -

nine cases , diabetes mellitus type ii - two cases , migraine - eight cases , intractable tachycardia , persistent hypotension , irritable bowel syndrome ( two cases each ) , systemic lupus erythematosus , thyrotoxicosis , multiple vitamin deficiency , obesity , mitral valve lesion and elephantiasis , one case each .\nthe total of those affected by chronic diseases and conditions was 190 cases ( 8% of the total ) .\nobstetric and gynecological morbid conditions included three cases of threatened abortion , nine cases of post - natal complications of non - specified nature , problems with intrauterine devices , miscarriage and uterine prolapse ( one case each ) , three cases of menstrual irregularities , sickle cell disease coupled with pregnancy , emesis graviderum ( two each ) , and six cases of ovarian cyst .\nsurgical problems included six cases of piles , three cases of lympadenopathy , goiterous lesion , multiple nasal polyps , tumor mass ( one testicular , two breast and one bone ) , one case each of anal fissure , paraumblical hernia , varicose leg ulcer , splenomegaly and facial lesion requiring cosmetic surgery .\ndental lesions included six cases of impacted tooth , one case of jaw problems and 13 cases of cavitary dental lesions .\nthree cases each had presented with psychological problems of ill - defined nature such as insomnia , anxiety disorders , and two cases of intractable anorexia .\ntraumatic lesions and injuries were disproportionately more common in males ( 76% of total traumatic lesions ) .\nwaxy ear , epistaxis , non - specified central nervous lesion , were the main categories encountered among the no - diagnosis group .\nout of 2472 consultations , 134 ( 6% ) cases were referred to tertiary level of care ( tables 2 and 3 ) .\nconditions of infectious nature were less referred compared to non - infectious conditions ( 3.7 % vs. 8.7% ) . despite the high prevalence of respiratory tract infections , they were the least referred ( < 1% ) . the referral rate for dental problems which was almost 11% , required further interventions not available at this level of care .\nsome of these were dental abscesses , gingival polyps , impacted tooth , and jaw lesions .\nthere was a higher rate of referrals for skin lesions especially abscesses ( 46 % ) .\nthe rate of referrals for pilonidial sinus and abscesses was 75% , while hepatitis was 40% .\nwomen presenting for the first antenatal care visit were 127 of the 184 ( 89% ) married women who represented about 31% of the total number of females in the study .\nabout 19 % ( 24 cases ) of attendees for antenatal care were referred to other primary care facilities or tertiary level of care . threatened abortion ( two cases ) , ovarian cysts ( three cases ) , pregnancy with sickle cell anemia and uterine prolapse ( one case each ) were the main reasons for referral in obstetric and gynecological cases\n. referred to tertiary level for proper management and further investigation were 8% of the anemic cases as well as sickle crisis ( four cases ) , two cases of sickle cell disease and one case with sickle cell and thalasemia .\nthere was a high rate of referral for traumatic lesions and injuries ( 28 % ) ; as was rate of those presenting with traumatic lumbo - sacral sprains .\nthere was a high rate of referrals for surgical conditions ( 50% ) ; and 27% for chronic conditions .\nthere was no documentation on the final diagnosis attained at the level of referral , type of procedures conducted , or patient outcome in any of the included records .\nthe relationship between the diagnosed morbidity and residence revealed that respiratory problems less frequently occurred in rural residents compared to urban and hostel residents ( 36.4% vs. 41.6 and 47.8 respectively , p 0.000 ) , while skin affection was significantly more among rural residents ( 10.5% vs. 6.7 and 8.4 % in urban and hostels residents , p 0.001 ) .\nfigures 1 and 2 illustrate the seasonal variation shown in the hijri calendar months of some morbidity problems .\nrespiratory tract problems showed two peaks , the first in muharram , and the second in shaban when the peak was higher .\nmuscle and joint problems exhibited the same pattern as oro - dental but was less pronounced in safar .\nskin lesions showed variations in muharram with a main peak in rajab rather then shaban .\nseasonal variation of respiratory , oro - dental , and musculoskeletal morbidity recorded among king faisal university students seasonal variation of the encountered eye , skin and gastrointestinal morbidity recorded among king faisal university students\nthe results of this study are consistent with others conducted in different parts of the world regarding the pattern of morbidity encountered at the primary level of care .\nthe study of the utilization of primary health care , revealed that in saudi arabia , acute respiratory infections were the commonest form of morbidity followed by gastrointestinal problems.5 a similar record - based study conducted in pakistan using the international classification of diseases coding system ( icd ) showed that diseases of the respiratory tract were the most commonly encountered in all age groups followed by other infections , parasitic infestations , diseases of the skin and those affecting the nervous system.6 the above study showed that females were the clients of the primary care services in a ratio of 2:1 males , which is also consistent with what was obtained in our study with regard to the pattern of primary health care utilization at king faisal university 's medical center . in this age group ,\nthe women presenting for the first antenatal care visit constituted 85% of the total married women , which was far more than other studies at the level of primary health care including the whole spectrum of the population .\nit was also found that about 20% women of this reproductive age group utilized phc services for antenatal care.7 this difference could be explained by the fact that our study included women within the peak period of their fertility .\nresults obtained from the current study in this particular age group also agrees with those obtained from other cross - sectional studies to determine the pattern of morbidity among adolescents in riyadh city , in which out of the sample of 1473 , upper respiratory infections constituted 43% of the complaints.8 in another study to determine the workload of the primary health care services in the summer , it was revealed that respiratory problems represented 60% followed by 20% in digestive problems in those who used the curative services , most of whom were young , adolescent saudis.5 a case - control study conducted in finland to portray the socio - demographic characteristics and the psychosocial profile of the frequent attendees at the primary health care revealed that females more significantly utilized the available services .\nthis is consistent with our findings . in this study , using the icd-9 , the most commonly encountered problems in the over 15 years age group were musculoskeletal disorders , respiratory , and digestive problems .\nthe reason for this is that frequent users had more mental problems than controls.9 in 4% of the cases , no specific diagnosis was recorded , which is far less than the results obtained in a similar study which claimed that the records of 46 % of all visits to primary health care did not include any kind of diagnosis . in addition , this study revealed that non - communicable diseases namely hypertension , diabetes , bronchial asthma , eye , ear , cardiologic and dermatologic problems were the main problems encountered among the adult subjects.10 the previous conclusions conflict with those obtained in our study as the included subjects were younger .\nseveral studies revealed that dental problems were peculiar to the pediatric age group,681012 while in this study it represented 9% of all morbidity of the age group 18 to 35 years .\nthis may reveal the reason for the persistence of these problems in the transition to adulthood and the reasons for encountering them in the primary health care services .\nthe problems of chronic morbidity among the age group in our study was bronchial asthma ( 6% ) as the most commonly diagnosed disorder .\nthis finding is in accord with that revealed by another survey conducted among 1473 saudi adolescents attending primary health care . in that study ,\nabout 10% of those between the ages 15 - 24 years had a chronic morbidity condition , the most frequently diagnosed being bronchial asthma.7 this study revealed a nearly constant trend of the rate of referral to the higher level of care ( 6% of cases ) as was found in a study to ascertain the morbidity pattern and evaluate the referral system in primary health centers in jeddah , kingdom of saudi arabia . in that study , 5% of the patients were referred to secondary and tertiary health care levels .\nthe feedback was only in 22.7% , and the majority of referral letters lacked the necessary information on the patient.13 in our study , there was no documentation of the feedback and the validity of the referral letters was questionable .\nour results on the seasonal variation of the morbidity problems included , particularly on respiratory , gastrointestinal and skin problems , match those obtained from other studies , where the peak incidence of respiratory and gastrointestinal problems was in late winter and mid - summer . for skin lesions ,\nthe highest peak was early in the summer.714 this study raised the important issue of recording morbidity encountered in phc settings .\nproper morbidity recording is vital in phc practices since they reflects the changing needs of the served population and would therefore aid the preparation of the centre and health team to deal with the dynamically changeable health problems.15 finally , the included medical records demonstrated a great deal of inconsistency , lack of agreement , identification , and retrieval difficulties .\none of the basic practices of community - oriented primary care ( copc ) is to record morbidity in a standardized easily retrievable fashion that allowed the user to monitor the health of the community by means of simple analytic procedures .\na proper recording system may aid the processes of the prediction of disease , evaluation of the health needs , and the determination of the logistic , technical and training requirements of the health team at the primary care level.16\n\n standardization of problem - oriented medical records would be helpful in providing information about different patterns of morbidity encountered at the level of primary health care.the patterns emerging may provide a strong foundation for health promotive activities especially in the field of health education , particularly on how to avoid exposure to risk factors of conditions such as dental problems , allergic disorders , and respiratory and other infections .\nthey would also assist in the tracking of chronic diseases , the promotion of lifestyle modification and the proper utilization of the available health services.a standardized referral system is required to improve the link between health providers and the selection of the best evidence - based management protocol to bring about the necessary favorable outcome for the patient . \n \nstandardization of problem - oriented medical records would be helpful in providing information about different patterns of morbidity encountered at the level of primary health care .\nthe patterns emerging may provide a strong foundation for health promotive activities especially in the field of health education , particularly on how to avoid exposure to risk factors of conditions such as dental problems , allergic disorders , and respiratory and other infections .\nthey would also assist in the tracking of chronic diseases , the promotion of lifestyle modification and the proper utilization of the available health services . a standardized referral system is required to improve the link between health providers and the selection of the best evidence -

nuclear antibody levels ( 1:80 ) , we decided to conduct an ultrasonography - guided percutaneous liver biopsy to differentiate autoimmune hepatitis from toxic hepatitis . on the ninth day in hospital ,\nthe liver biopsy was performed at 1:00 p.m. we marked the biopsy site on the skin during ultrasonography and shot an 18-gauge spring - loaded liver biopsy needle ( angiomed autovac biopsy needle ; bard , karlsruhe , germany ) at the biopsy site twice .\non the first shot , we obtained a 0.7 cm - sized tissue piece and the patient did not complain of any symptoms . on the second shot , a 3 cm - sized liver tissue was obtained .\nthe patient then complained that she felt a twinge - like pain in her right chest that radiated into the right shoulder .\nanalgesics were administered , after which the pain and dyspnea gradually subsided . at that time , the patient 's vitals were stable and further sequelae were not expected . on the same day , at 11:30\nwe suspected the patient was suffering from hemorrhagic shock due to bleeding from an iatrogenic liver injury .\nabdominal ct showed that the right lobe of the liver was severely compressed by a huge subcapsular hematoma ( fig .\n1 ) . packed red blood cells ( rbcs ) and crystalloid were administered and inotrophics were infused . at the same time , an emergency angiography was performed which revealed that the bleeding came from the right hepatic artery .\nthe patient 's blood pressure remained relatively stable after the procedure , but began to fall when we tried to taper off the dose of inotrophics .\na second angiogram obtained on the tenth day in hospital showed no evidence of arterial bleeding .\nthe patient was admitted to the intensive care unit ( icu ) . despite being transfused with 10 , 3 , 3 , and 2 units of packed rbc on days 10 , 11 , 12 , and 13 , respectively , the patient 's hemoglobin levels gradually decreased from 13.1 to 8.8 g / dl . in total ,\n18 units ( 4,500 ml ) of packed rbc were transfused prior to the infusion of rfviia . on the eleventh day in hospital , the patient was given 500,000 units of aprotinin ( rotinin inj ; han lim pharm , seoul , korea ) over 15 min as the loading dose , after which 200,000 units were infused continuously each hour for 5 h as the maintenance dose . despite the injection of aprotinin ,\nthe patient 's hemoglobin levels decreased persistently . on the twelfth day in hospital , the patient was given 2.4 mg ( 40 g / kg ) of rfviia 4 times every 2 hours , and then 4.8 mg ( 80 g / kg ) 3 times every 2 hours . on day 13 ,\nthe blood pressure and hemoglobin levels of the patient stabilized in the absence of transfusion ( fig .\n, the patient 's laboratory results revealed that her prothrombin time was 20.7 s ( inr 2.03 ) , her activated partial thromboplastin time was 82.0 s , her fibrin degradation product level was 17.5 g / ml , and her d - dimer level was 6,245 ng / ml . the patient was treated in the icu for 2 months because of the intra - abdominal and the intrathoracic hematoma and its complications , namely dic due to massive transfusion , acute renal failure , acute respiratory failure , and liver failure due to liver necrosis .\nthe patient recovered gradually from these complications in terms of liver injury and jaundice ( fig .\na follow - up ct scan showed a considerable reduction in the size of the subcapsular hematoma .\nthe results of the liver biopsy were compatible with toxic hepatitis , but we remained unable to exclude autoimmune hepatitis completely .\nwe describe here a patient with subcapsular hematoma that developed after percutaneous liver biopsy . to obtain hemostasis , we attempted embolization of the right hepatic artery and intravenous injections with aprotinin .\nthese methods failed to stem the gradual decrease in hemoglobin levels that persisted despite the transfusion of large amounts of packed rbcs .\nfinally , four 40 g / kg doses and three 80 g / kg doses of rfviia were administered intravenously .\nclinically significant intraperitoneal hemorrhage is the most serious bleeding complication of percutaneous liver biopsy . the mortality rate among patients after percutaneous liver biopsy is approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 12,000 [ 1 , 6 ] .\ntwo cases of subcapsular hematoma have been reported , one in a patient receiving a liver graft and the other in a patient with cholestatic liver disease .\nthe present case had severe cholestasis associated with toxic hepatitis , but no underlying chronic liver disease [ 3 , 7 ] .\nif hemorrhage is suspected , the administration of iv fluids and blood products should be performed immediately to improve the patient 's hemodynamic status , and a surgeon and an angiographer should be kept on standby . if hemodynamic instability persists for a few hours despite the use of aggressive resuscitative measures , angiography and embolization or surgical exploration are indicated .\nit is generally believed that timely percutaneous external drainage of the large hematoma is needed to prevent the compression of functioning hepatocytes , which may harm the liver , although some authors insist that it may remove the tamponade effect of the hematoma on the bleeding focus .\nwhile rfviia was developed to manage bleeding in hemophiliac patients who express inhibitors of clotting factors , it was unclear why rfviia but not endogenous fvii could overcome coagulopathy in hemophiliac patients\n. a cell - based conceptual model of hemostasis that focuses on the roles of specific cell surfaces in controlling the coagulation process may shed light on this phenomenon .\nfviia can bind to activated platelets and , once bound to the activated platelet surface , can activate factor x. the cell - based model suggests that while the low levels of endogenous fviia can not induce thrombin generation on the platelet surface , when rfviia is added to the system , thereby elevating the total fviia levels , the thrombin - generating function of the platelet surface can be restored . in the present case ,\nrfviia was administered after we identified and embolized the bleeding focus in the course of right hepatic artery because the bleeding did not stop , even though there was no obvious bleeding point after embolization , as indicated by the second angiography .\nthus , we can presume that the administration of rfviia successfully controlled the undisclosed bleeding from the site where the biopsy was performed . which dose of rfviia is appropriate for a bleeding patient who does not have deficiency of coagulation factor vii ?\none study showed that when patients with chronic liver disease are given 80 g / kg rviia prior to surgical incision during orthotopic liver transplantation , it is both safe and effective .\nanother study showed that the decline in hematocrit during an operation undergoing liver resection was smallest in the group receiving 80 g / kg of rfviia , and that this was associated with a significant overall improved effect of treatment . in our patient , we administered a half dose of rfviia 3 times on the twelfth day . on the thirteenth day in hospital\n, we administered the full dose of rfviia 3 times because the half dose was suboptimal for hemostasis , totaling 400 g / kg .\nrfviia is effective for hemostasis not only in hemophiliac patients , but also in patients with thrombocytopathies , liver transplantation [ 9 , 13 ] , and hemophiliac patients undergoing orthopedic surgery .\nwe would like to report the successful use of rfviia in a dic patient with potentially fatal iatrogenic bleeding .\nwe also suggest that dic should be omitted from the contraindication list of rfviia use ."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " recombinant activated coagulation factor vii ( rfviia ) is known to be effective in the management of acquired deficiencies of factor vii and platelet function defects . but \n recently , rfviia has been successfully used to treat ongoing bleeding in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy ( dic ) condition . \n the patient reported here was suspected to be suffering from toxic hepatitis on admission . \n after percutaneous liver biopsy , bleeding occurred and did not stop even after right hepatic artery embolization . \n the patient developed a severe hemorrhage that resulted in hypovolemic shock , hemoperitoneum , and a massive subcapsular hematoma . \n the patient then developed dic due to massive transfusion , as well as acute liver necrosis . \n the patient was given 400 g / kg of rfviia . \n recombinant factor viia was administered in an attempt to control the bleeding . \n this stabilized the hemoglobin levels of the patient . \n the patient gradually recovered in 4 months . in conclusion \n , this case suggests that rfviia can be successfully used for the hemostasis of uncontrolled bleeding in dic .
